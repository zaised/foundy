You attack by rolling the 20-sided die (or d20 for short) and adding your attack bonus (which represents your skill at wielding a weapon). If the total is equal to or greater than the target's Armor Class (AC for short), then the attack is a hit and deals damage. Subtract the damage from the target's Hit Points (HP for short). To defeat them, you must reduce their HP <span style=\"font-family:var(--main-font);font-size:var(--body-font-size)\">to 0 bor less.</span></p>\n<p>On their turn, your enemy will likely attack you- you'll roll a d20 for them, add their attack bonus, and compare the result to your AC. If the enemy reduces you to 0 HP or less, you die.</p>\n<p>Finally, if your attack roll exceeds the enemy's AC by 10 or more, it's a critical hit and you deal double damage (roll once, and double the result). You also score a critical hit against the enemy if the result of the die roll shows a \"20\" on the die. When the enemy attacks you, it can score a critical hit only if the die roll is a 20.</p>\n<h3>Rounds and Actions</h3>\n<p>Combat occurs in rounds. In each round, both you and the enemy take turns, and on each turn, you can use 3 actions. Once you have used your actions, it's the enemy's turn. After it uses 3 actions, it's your turn again. This repeats until one side is defeated. Actions are denoted by the action symbol (<span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span>).</p>\n<p>Although you can attack three times in one turn, each time you attack in a single round, each subsequent attack becomes less accurate.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":0.781,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-06T16:46:26.201+01:00","version":{"schema":0.778,"foundry":"10.284","system":"4.0.0-beta1"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"iwlf9gmin8SuOnuV","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.zVf0Hlp5xG0Q7kmc"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/skilled-heritage.webp","name":"Skilled Heritage","sort":0,"type":"heritage","folder":null,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of skills.

Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR]{Drain Bonded Item} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You haven't acted yet on your turn</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.</p>\n<h2>Arcane School</h2>\n<p>Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility.</p>\n<p>Arcane schools can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gCwcys8CnS102tji]{Arcane School: Abjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SNeVaUBTHwvoO6kr]{Arcane School: Conjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.yobGgrHdgjs5QW5o]{Arcane School: Divination}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHwGACWQEy6kTzcP]{Arcane School: Enchantment}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibhml5y20g5M3Vgd]{Arcane School: Evocation}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.K6hG7nH8yjmbA0Q9]{Arcane School: Illusion}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uNM7qZQokRKAEd7k]{Arcane School: Necromancy}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.rHxkPijLnQ9O9AGV]{Arcane School: Transmutation} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qczCKdg47eAmCOUD]{Arcane School: Universalist})</p>\n<h2>Arcane Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3-19: Wizard Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Crimson Libram</em>, or something more academic, like <em>A Field Study in Practical Transmutation</em>.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The Archwizard's Spellcraft class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Arcane Thesis</h2>\n<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like \"On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.\"</p>\n<p>Arcane thesis can be found here @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.M89l9FOnjHe63wD7]{Arcane Thesis}.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through a combination of magic and training, you've learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively. You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, staff, and unarmed attacks.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Archwizard's Spellcraft<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tP26mgaFPpr6df1i]{Archwizard's Might} feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You are a consummate spellcaster, with a comprehensive understanding of both arcane theory and practical spellcraft.

unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.</p>\n<p>Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<p>A list of all deities can be found in the Deities compendium.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anathema</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone}</em> ritual.</p>\n<h2>Divine Font</h2>\n<p>Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heal}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wdA52JJnsuQWeyqz]{Harm}</em> spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em>. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Font</strong> You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>heal</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Harmful Font</strong> You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>harm</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-9: Cleric Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* Your divine font gives you additional <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em> spells of this level.

At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine's second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.</p>\n<p>Doctrines can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZZzLMOUAtBVgV1DF]{Cloistered Cleric} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.0Aocw3igLwna9cjp]{Warpriest}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Cleric Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you.

After leaving the world in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves are objects of awe—graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on living up to these ideals.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Elves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Valuing kindness and beauty, elves ever strive to improve their manners, appearance, and culture.</p>\n<p>Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, but for a specific reason: they subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions. There's a physical element to this attunement, but it isn't only superficial. Elves who spend their lives among shorter‑lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the Forlorn.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans, either keeping a careful emotional distance or resigning yourself to outliving them.</li>\n<li>Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.</li>\n<li>Have features such as eye color, skin tone, hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment in which you live.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.</li>\n<li>Assume you practice archery, cast spells, fight demons, and have perfected one or more fine arts.</li>\n<li>Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, featuring large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.</p>\n<p>Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.</p>\n<p>Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century, once they've experienced more, held several occupations, and outlived a generation of shorter-lived people. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity. They've since returned, but rebuilding is no easy task. Their inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge. Elven architecture displays their deep appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.</p>\n<p>Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call ilduliel, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. As such, many are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Many elves adventure to find beauty and discover new things. Typical backgrounds for an elf include emissary, hunter, noble, scholar, or scout. Elves often become rangers or rogues, taking advantage of their dexterity, or alchemists or wizards, exploring their intellectual curiosity.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>An elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically—at least in the Elven tongue. They so commonly end in '-el' or '-ara' that other cultures sometimes avoid names ending in these syllables to avoid sounding too elven.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["elf","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"elf","schema":{"version":0.781,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-06T16:46:26.187+01:00","version":{"schema":0.778,"foundry":"10.284","system":"4.0.0-beta1"}}},"hp":6,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["con"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","elven"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["celestial","draconic","gnoll","gnomish","goblin","orcish","sylvan"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"lowLightVision","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"jaPfdIXADWJgjIcq","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.AogIo1gHLdz7DyHx"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/feats/feats.webp","name":"Forlorn","sort":0,"type":"feat","folder":null,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Watching your friends age and die fills you with moroseness that protects you against harmful emotions.

Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":0.781,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-06T16:46:26.183+01:00","version":{"schema":0.778,"foundry":"10.284","system":"4.0.0-beta1"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"8Fr8o3RIQUZMpZR5","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.zVf0Hlp5xG0Q7kmc"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/skilled-heritage.webp","name":"Skilled Heritage","sort":0,"type":"heritage","folder":null,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of skills.

You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have master proficiency.</p>\n<h2>Battlefield Surveyor<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Whether taking stock of an enemy army or simply standing guard, you excel at observing your foes. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.

You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.

When you make your daily preparations, you gain one fighter feat of 8th level or lower that you don't already have. You can use that feat until your next daily preparations. You must meet all of the feat's other prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have spent so much time wearing armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency rank for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your fighter class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned fighting techniques that apply to all armaments, and you've developed unparalleled skill with your favorite weapons.

When you use combat flexibility, you can gain two fighter feats instead of one. While the first feat must still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and you can use the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second feat. You must meet all of the feats' prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, increasing your ability to prevent blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You are nigh-unmatched with any weapon. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to legendary, and your proficiency rank for advanced weapons increases to master. Your proficiency rank for your fighter class DC increases to master.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"fighter","schema":{"version":0.781,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-06T16:46:26.183+01:00","version":{"schema":0.778,"foundry":"10.284","system":"4.0.0-beta1"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"0c3e5":{"id":"F5VenhIQMDkeGvmV","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-legend.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon Legend","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"2jey6":{"id":"bAaI7h937Nr3g93U","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/fighter-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Fighter Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"9c5ay":{"id":"x5jaCJxsmD5sx3KB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Armor Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"e1e4m":{"id":"eZNCckLzbH3GyncH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/shield-block.webp","level":1,"name":"Shield Block","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"enizk":{"id":"W2rwudMNcAxs8VoX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-flexibility.webp","level":15,"name":"Improved Flexibility","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"ij943":{"id":"TIvzBALymvb56L79","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/battlefield-surveyor.webp","level":7,"name":"Battlefield Surveyor","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"lakjk":{"id":"GJKJafDGuX4BeAeN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bravery.webp","level":3,"name":"Bravery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"lphi1":{"id":"OMZs5y16jZRW9KQK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","level":9,"name":"Juggernaut","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"q0xyz":{"id":"CGB1TczFhQhdQxml","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-mastery.webp","level":17,"name":"Armor Mastery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"r6269":{"id":"hmShTfPOcTaKgbf4","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/attack-of-opportunity.webp","level":1,"name":"Attack of Opportunity","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"r6jbx":{"id":"MV6XIuAgN9uSA0Da","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","level":15,"name":"Evasion","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"txlgu":{"id":"8g6HzARbhfcgilP8","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/combat-flexibility.webp","level":9,"name":"Combat Flexibility","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"u1d1r":{"id":"9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":7,"name":"Weapon Specialization","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"u8k07":{"id":"gApJtAdNb9ST4Ms9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/fighter-weapon-mastery.webp","level":5,"name":"Fighter Weapon Mastery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"vis8d":{"id":"Z7HX6TeFsaup7Dx9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","level":15,"name":"Greater Weapon Specialization (Level 15)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"x98c2":{"id":"0H2LxtiZTJ275pSD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/versatile-legend.webp","level":19,"name":"Versatile Legend","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"}},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":3},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":2,"martial":2,"advanced":1,"unarmed":2,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":1},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"hrdq4ubxm5vpceg6","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.KAVf7AmRnbCAHrkT"},"pf2e":{"grantedBy":{"id":"lmz0qqgk68hb1a03"}}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Attack of Opportunity","sort":0,"type":"action","folder":null,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

The Pathfinder Beginner Box contains everything you need to learn how to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, including rules to create your own fantasy hero and tools to make your own amazing stories.</p><p>Welcome to the Pathfinder Beginner Box! This module has been constructed from the ground up to provide you with a simple but detailed introduction to the Pathfinder Second Edition game system, as well as how to make the most out of its features in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. As you progress through the Menace Under Otari adventure, the Journal Entries you read will provide you with instructions on everything from game rules to software usage.</p><h2>Where to start?</h2><p>Most of the contents of this module are heavily interlinked, which means that you don't need to worry too much about reading something out of order. If something is relevant, we'll try to link to it, so you should always only be a click away from context at any point. However, it can be daunting to just dive in, so here are some recommended starting points!</p><ul><li><p>If you're new to Foundry, then some of the tabs on the left hand side will explain how to use the various types of content included in this adventure.</p></li><li><p>If you'd like to learn more about the rules of the Pathfinder Second Edition system, then the @UUID[JournalEntry.OoPjlnYYGLn5KPZy.JournalEntryPage.pgOC3zCWvUFGiuTj]{What's a Roleplaying Game?} journal exists to walk you through the key concepts and ideas.</p></li><li><p>If you'd like to dive right in to the Menace Under Otari adventure, then all you need to do is gather up some players and consult the @UUID[JournalEntry.67xrow8BHnKbKozv]{Introduction} to see how to get started. Make sure to share the @UUID[JournalEntry.KIpNnMtah73eyPC8]{Creating Your Hero} journal with your players, as well!</p></li><li><p>If you don't have a group yet, the solo adventure @UUID[JournalEntry.MNx5B6xIGsHwGzqe]{Pirate King's Plunder} can be a great introduction to ease you into the action.</p></li></ul><h2>Folders and Organisation</h2><p>While most of this module was designed to be read by the Gamemaster, there is still plenty of useful information and instruction in this module for players! The folders in each tab have been color-coded to indicate who can see their contents. If the folder has a red hue it is visible to all players. If the folder has no color assigned, it contains reference material only (such as credits or legal information). If the folder is green, it contains information that is visible to GMs only.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"RdCszAm0X9m9aRuy","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"title":{"show":false,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Informational Boxes","type":"text","_id":"rBcVbxR5q9zcFHai","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>To keep everything organized, the Journals contained on the Journal Entry Sidebar tab on the right were built with a standardized approach to 'box text' to make it easier to learn.

They can be played individually, but clicking play on the playlist activates all three simultaneously, providing a soundscape with a faint bass drone of being underground, periodic wet drips to indicate a seaside cavern structure, and the sounds of rodents chittering and scratching.</li><li><strong>Floor 1 Exploration Ambience</strong> - This playlist only contains a single audio file, a looping string of dramatic piano notes to add some musical themes of sneaky exploration. It is best used in conjunction with other ambience playlists.</li><li><strong>Floor 2 Exploration Ambience</strong> - This playlist only contains a single audio file, a looping drone meant to convey the feeling of exploring a cavern deeper underground. It is best used in conjunction with other ambience playlists.</li><li><strong>Floor 2 Mermaid Fountain</strong> - a faint ominous drone and amplified sounds of running water which, when coupled with the on-scene Ambient sounds of water running should provide a clear audio cue to players that something might be wrong and dangerous with the fountain.</li><li><strong>Floor 2 Soggy Crossroads</strong> - This playlist should be used when players breach the barricade shortly after entering the second floor, as they near the water. It mixes the faint exploration piano from the first floor with heavy sounds of running water.</li><li><strong>Otari Fishery </strong>- The goal of this track is to convey the sounds of a busy and bustling establishment, with drink and games served and the sounds of workers. It should be used when the players speak with Tamily.</li><li><strong>Otari Wharf</strong> - A mix of sea birds and ocean waves to draw the players imagination to the sounds of a seaside town.</li><li><strong>Soundboard Loops</strong> - This is a soundboard containing looping tracks which can be drawn upon to evoke particular sound effects. For example, during the encounter with the Cinder Rat you may wish to play the \"Everything is Fire\" track until the rat is defeated, or when your players breach the first barricade to explore northward, you may wish to begin playing \"The Malevolent Dead\".</li></ul><p><strong>Sound Effects</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Barricades </strong>- these are the sound effect tracks which occur when players are removing the barricades, and can be replayed from here if the players miss out on hearing them.</li><li><strong>Dragon Soundboard</strong> - Intended for use while players move into the Mushroom Grotto, these effects allow you to indicate the presence of a dragon and then, as combat begins, the sounds of the dragon attacking or being injured.</li><li><strong>The Cinder Rat</strong> - The sound effect which plays when the Cinder Rat explodes out of the orb in @UUID[JournalEntry.qFSLpCM2cpRQWCR2.JournalEntryPage.7Ko4GJeI1K3Vy1Xp]{Area 14: Elements of Chaos}</li></ul></article></section>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":350000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Journals","type":"text","_id":"G7OWgllAAdbco6N4","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<aside class=\"bb-float-block\"><h3>Dynamic Links</h3><p>Throughout these journals you will find a variety of in-line links.

The rest of the area’s text includes all the information you need about what the heroes will come across in this area. This text contains spoilers for the room—it gives you information about the challenges the heroes face as they explore the area. If the area includes combat, traps, hazards, or treasure, the rules for those are in this text.</p><p>As they move through the dungeon levels, the players will use their heroes’ skills and abilities to explore the area and overcome its obstacles. It’s likely they’ll have questions and try actions that aren’t covered by the rules. As the GM, you get to make up the answers and decide what happens, but always try to be fair, and remember that the goal of the game is for everyone to have a fun time. You should encourage the heroes to try new things as they learn, but don’t forget that, as new adventurers, their heroes’ abilities are limited.</p><p>If the players get stuck or confused about what to do next, you can give them a few hints or ideas to get them started, like “Do you want to open the door?” or “Who wants to look for hidden treasure?” Remember that this is their first game, too, and they will have more fun if everyone is participating.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":375000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.67xrow8BHnKbKozv.JournalEntryPage.dDoSNqIn4nfBbZ9W"}}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.0-alpha1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662411776558,"lastModifiedBy":"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r"}},{"_id":"ENyKNEGLOOT4GfO1","name":"Alignments and Deities","folder":"gWYQ6AssXJE1noqA","sort":-337500,"flags":{"pf2e-beginner-box":{"isBB":true}},"pages":[{"name":"Alignments","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Alignments are a quick and easy way to summarise your character's moral axioms and priorities.

If you're making new characters, your GM can create new sheets for you by clicking \"Create Actor\" on the actors tab of the sidebar.

The system includes all of this data for you- you need only apply it to your character!</p><p>On the \"compendiums\" tab of your sidebar, at the bottom, there is a button labelled \"Compendium Browser\".

You can use this to quickly find the features you'd like to choose, and then drag them from this window onto your character sheet. It's as simple as that!</p><h3>Character Creation Rules</h3><p>In some places, the rules or character options presented in the Pathfinder Beginner Box PDF may differ from those this used in these journal pages or in the PF2E system. This is because the Beginner Box presents a simplified and streamlined set of rules in the interest of making the system a little easier to learn.</p><p>Because a virtual tabletop handles a lot of the minutia and complexity that comes from learning the mechanics of a new game system, we've chosen to stick to the full rules as outlined in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook.</p><p>However, you're welcome to refer back to the Beginner Box PDF if you would like to play with those rules instead.

The ways in which Ability Boosts are managed are outlined in the @UUID[JournalEntry.mrmEfL8tRhGltGJX.JournalEntryPage.lygt82lIvFJVGsUA]{Modifying Ability Scores} journal page.</p><h2>Heritages</h2><p>After you've chosen an Ancestry, you'll also choose one of the ancestry's heritages, which expand on your character's origins and abilities. You can only have one Heritage, and you can't change your choice later.</p><p>You can choose a heritage in the same way that you chose your ancestry, or you can take one of the recommended options for each ancestry which are detailed in the associated pages of this journal. Either way, make sure to read the description of your heritage so that you understand which benefits it is providing to you.</p><p>Some heritages can be taken by members of any Ancestry. These are called Versatile Heritages. For instance, a member of any ancestry could be born with traces of fiendish blood in their veins, and so Tieflings are a versatile heritage. As well as the other benefits of a Heritage, a Versatile Heritage also offers you an expanded pool of options when choosing Ancestry Feats.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><p>Every hero chooses an Ancestry Feat at first level. You can find your feat slots by going to the Features tab, under the Ancestry Feat header. There should be an empty slot, which you can fill in two ways. You can drag an ancestry feat into that slot to choose it, or you can press the magnifying glass icon to open up the compendium browser with some helpfully preconfigured filters.</p><p>Note that if you chose a Versatile Heritage, you may also be able to choose feats from your Heritage as well as from your Ancestry.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.0-alpha1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662224889810,"lastModifiedBy":"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r"}},{"_id":"mrmEfL8tRhGltGJX","name":"Ability Scores","folder":"gWYQ6AssXJE1noqA","sort":200000,"flags":{"pf2e-beginner-box":{"isBB":true}},"pages":[{"name":"Ability Scores","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Ability Scores represent your hero’s raw potential.

The Pathfinder Second Edition system for Foundry operates under the assumption you are playing with the core rules. If you are using the Beginner Box rules, the information contained within these journal handouts and the class item's \"details\" tab may not apply to your character.</p><p>One of the ways in which the Beginner Box streamlines the core rules is by removing the concept of an ability score. Instead, Ability Boosts directly increase your modifier. As such, at times, the Beginner Box might tell you to increase your ability modifier by one. This is equivalent to an Ability Boost and should increase your ability scores by 2- it does not mean that you increase your score by one (for example, from 10 to 11).</p></article></section>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"3.13.5","coreVersion":"10.277","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1660582343657,"lastModifiedBy":"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r"}},{"_id":"k2bOm2AUnF7u547y","name":"Gamemaster's Guide","folder":"LblI3YBfHwUEF4jt","sort":-100000,"flags":{"pf2e-beginner-box":{"isBB":true},"pf2e-abomination-vaults":{"isAV":true}},"pages":[{"name":"Creating Your Own Adventure","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Building your own adventure is more challenging than using a published one, but it lets you express yourself, apply even more creativity, and tailor the game directly to the players and their heroes!</p><p>Even if you're using a prewritten adventure, you can also use these guidelines to alter the story to suit your preferences, or to continue the game after the adventure ends.</p><h3>Building a Campaign</h3><p>Just because an adventure ends, it doesn’t mean the whole game has to! You can continue with the same group and heroes in an ongoing campaign. A campaign is a connected series of adventures. You can build new adventures based on what happened in the last one, or you can adapt prewritten adventures to carry on the story.</p><p>Campaigns work better if you carry forward some NPCs, themes, and villains from adventure to adventure. For example, after “Menace under Otari,” you can use the @JournalEntry[NNmKsnjJOZogP2fO]{Otari} section to get some ideas for what you might include in your next adventure. You can also get more adventures for your campaign with the Pathfinder Adventures book Troubles in Otari or the three-book Adventure Path Abomination Vaults.</p><p>As you get more used to being a Game Master, you can start planning out campaigns from the start, with different themes and styles. But for your first game, it’s usually best to start with one adventure and expand from there to get the hang of GMing.</p><h2>The Story</h2><p>When you decide to build an adventure, first come up with a basic plot or theme for it. Think of this step like casting a play rather than writing out every scene. You’re picking enemies and places where cool things can take place, but only by improvising with the other players during play will you find out what happens!</p><p>Adventure plotting can start at many different points. You might begin with a particular antagonist, then construct an adventure that fits that villain’s theme and leads the group to them. Alternatively, you could start with an interesting location for exploration, then populate it with adversaries and challenges appropriate to the setting.</p><p>If you’re stuck for ideas, roll [[/r 1d8]] and look up the result on the table below! You can customize and change these ideas however you like.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>d8 Roll</th><th>Storyline</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Something in the town’s water is making animals go feral.

An adventure is a self-contained collection of story elements, characters, and settings that become the basis for the story you and the other players tell. Think of the adventure as an outline for your story. You’ll have major plot points you want to include, some consistent characters, and themes you want to convey, but all sorts of things can change during the process of turning the outline into a completed story!</p><aside class=\"bb-float-block\"><h2>Common Terms</h2><p>The following terms are used to describe certain common game elements.</p><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A challenge is one short scene that puts the heroes to the test. This could be anything from fighting a monster to chasing a thief or getting past a deadly trap.</p><p><strong>Encounter:</strong> An encounter is a combat that plays out in a series of rounds with creatures taking actions in turn.</p><p><strong>Exploration:</strong> Between encounters, heroes are exploring. Usually, this means exploring an environment, but they might explore a social situation, a puzzle, or something else.</p><p><strong>Session:</strong> A session is a single period of gaming, ranging from about 2 hours up to an entire weekend. In a session, you might complete a whole adventure or just part of one.</p><p><strong>Adventure:</strong> An adventure is one story that the heroes experience. It’s made up of a series of explorations broken up by a series of encounters. Adventures might take one or more sessions to complete.</p><p><strong>Campaign:</strong> Campaign is a term used to describe all of the adventures that the heroes experience. The adventures might relate to one another, but not all of the adventures have to be tied into the same overarching plot.</p></aside><h2>Types of Adventures</h2><p>Adventures can be structured in different ways. A linear adventure has a set path with one encounter leading to another. A nonlinear adventure involves creating an environment with multiple paths the heroes can explore in any order. Finally, a sandbox adventure takes place over a wide environment with the players setting their own goals. For your first adventures, start simple with either a fully linear adventure or one with only a small number of optional paths.</p><h3>Prewritten Adventures</h3><p>The @JournalEntry[67xrow8BHnKbKozv]{Menace Under Otari} adventure has much of the preparation done for you. Reading the adventure and looking over the materials in the Beginner Box gives you enough preparation to run that adventure. “Menace Under Otari” and other prewritten adventures are built for groups of a specific level. They include setup information and nonplayer characters (NPCs) needed for the story, plus all the locations, maps, and monster groups; they also give out the appropriate amount of XP and treasure. Running one as your first game can help you see how adventures are structured, which makes it easier to write your own later if you choose. Though a published adventure is prewritten, its events aren’t set in stone. Changing the details of an adventure to suit your group isn’t just OK, it’s preferred! Adjust things to make the adventure appeal to your players more, and add to the adventure in ways that will make your players happy.</p><h3>Writing an Adventure</h3><p>When writing your own adventures, you’ll need to prepare further by picking monsters, drawing maps, and coming up with NPCs that live in the world. This takes more time on your part but also lets you customize your game to your group. If you're interesting, turn to @UUID[.UyPEle3d3z9ncJzy]{Creating Your Own} for guidance on creating original adventures!</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"TO4Y6utnSpEVltuu","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1KQ6rs5BfeNzaFrd.JournalEntryPage.1XE5BfT499pcv5XZ"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Game Sessions","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>You play out an adventure over a series of sessions, which usually last several hours and involve multiple encounters and some exploration. Each session can noticeably differ from the last. Think of a session as an episode of a TV show—  it should include some twists, turns, and changes so that the players are excited about what comes next.</p><section class=\"character-creation\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Planning a Session</h3><p>Often, the responsibility of scheduling the game falls on you as the GM since you have to prepare the game between sessions. Choose a time everyone can attend and a place to gather, whether it's around the kitchen table or in an online space. Many games have a set schedule, such as once per week, once every 2 weeks, or once per month. (Your first game might not be so predictable, though!) The less frequently your group meets, the better notes and recaps you'll need to keep everyone on the same page. If another player wants to take session notes, that's great too, especially if they set up a shared document everyone can reference online.</p><p>Plan a time for everybody to arrive, and also try to set a time when playing the game will begin. Having this planned can make it easier for everyone to finish catching up so you can start playing the game. Having an end time in mind is also important. A typical game session lasts about 4 hours. Less than 2 hours usually isn't enough time to get much done.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Starting a Session</h3><p>Once everyone is ready to play, get everyone's attention and cover the following topics. These are in a rough order that you can change based on your group's style or a session's needs.</p><p>• Recap what happened during the previous sessions (if this isn't the first session).</p><p>• Establish where the heroes are at the beginning of this session. Have they been resting since their last challenge? Did you leave off with them in a hallway, preparing to raid the next room of a dungeon? Tell players whether their heroes had time to rest or recover since the last session.</p><p>• Establish goals. Repeat any goals the group already had, then let the players weigh in on whether these goals still apply and on whether there's anything else they hope to accomplish during the session.</p><p>• Commence adventuring! Usually the first thing you'll do in a session is describe the environment and sensations that surround the heroes, allowing them to react in the moment.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Running a Session</h3><p>During a session, you're in charge of keeping the game's action moving, answering questions, and making rules decisions. You'll also want to keep a rough eye on the time, so you can end when it's most convenient for the group.</p><p>You're the one who customizes the rules you need from the imagined world you and the other players share. It's up to you to establish what's true in the world, but you have help in doing so! You're informed by the setting's backstory, your preparations, and the suggestions the other players make. You can adjust things on the fly from what you planned, too. You might have an idea in your notes that changes when a player does something unexpected.</p><p>You'll determine when heroes and foes need to attempt checks as well as what happens as a result of their rolls, which comes up most often during exploration. In an encounter, a player can usually determine their own hero's turn with you chiming in only to say whether an attack hits or if something in the environment requires a hero to attempt a check.</p><h3>The Spotlight</h3><p>As you run the game, keep track of which player has the spotlight. You can easily keep attention on the most outgoing player or hero, but you need to check in with all the players. If a player hasn't contributed in some time, stop and ask, \"What's your hero doing at this point?\" If the player isn't sure, add a detail or NPC to the scene that the player might find interesting.</p><h3>Distractions and Interruptions</h3><p>Maintaining the players' attention keeps a game moving and leads to memorable moments when everyone's in the zone. Too many interruptions break the flow. Some distractions will always happen, like jokes at the table, but make sure interruptions aren't too frequent. It helps to plan breaks into the game. A 10-minute break is a great time to grab a snack, use the restroom, or look up something on your phone.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Ending a Session</h3><p>It's best to have a planned end time before your session starts. As your game goes on, keep an eye on the time. When you have around 20 minutes left in your session, start looking for good stopping places. Unless you're finishing up an adventure, try to find a good cliffhanger to end on. This can be just before a fight starts, the moment the heroes find out a new piece of information or enter a new area, or any other point that creates suspense!</p><p>Before everybody leaves, have them tally up their XP. They'll need to level up before the next session if it's over 1,000! The characters can also divide treasure and items.</p><p>Before your next session, you might need to prepare for the next stage of the adventure. If the adventure concluded this session, talk with the players about whether they want to start a new adventure. If so, start preparing the next adventure for your upcoming session!</p></article></section>"},"_id":"DloSYM1BvQgs0iVh","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.d6QRPibR8IU5wfKT.JournalEntryPage.WKocCepbXs2Y6jrC"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Rules Disputes","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>As the GM, you're responsible for resolving any questions or disputes about the rules.

Remember that all of these are guidelines, and you can adjust them as necessary to suit the situation.</p><hr /><h3>Balance (Acrobatics)</h3><p>Use @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]{Simple DCs} based on what the character is trying to balance across.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) tangled roots, uneven cobblestones</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) wooden beam</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) deep, loose gravel</p><hr /><h3>Climb (Athletics)</h3><p>Use @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]{Simple DCs} based on what the character is trying to climb up or across.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) ladder, low-branched tree, steep slope</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) rigging, rope, typical tree</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) wall with small handholds and footholds</p><hr /><h3>Decipher Writing</h3><p>Base the DC on how complex and hard to understand the text is. A hero doesn’t need to roll to read a text that’s written in plain language.</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) entry-level philosophy treatise</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) complex code, such as a cipher</p><hr /><h3>Gather Information (Diplomacy)</h3><p>To set the DC to Gather Information, use a  @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]{Simple DC} representing the availability of information about the subject. Adjust the DC upward if the hero seeks in-depth information.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) talk of the town</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) common rumor</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) obscure rumor, poorly guarded secret</p><hr /><h3>Identify Magic or Learn a Spell</h3><p>The DC to Identify Magic or Learn a Spell is the @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-5:-level-based-dcs]{Level-Based DC} for the spell or item’s level.</p><hr /><h3>Perform (Performance)</h3><p>Consider the audience’s exposure to the arts when picking the @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]{Simple DC}. How easy are they to impress?</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) audience of commoners</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) audience of artisans</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) audience of merchants or minor nobles</p><hr /><h3>Recall Knowledge</h3><p>On most topics, you can use simple DCs for checks to Recall Knowledge. For a check about a specific creature, trap, or other subject with a level, use a  @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-5:-level-based-dcs]{Level-Based DC}. You might adjust the difficulty down, maybe even drastically if the subject is famous.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) name of a ruler, key noble, or major deity</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) line of succession for a major noble family, core doctrines of a major deity</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) genealogy of a minor noble, teachings of an ancient priest</p><p>Sometimes a hero might want to follow up on a check to Recall Knowledge by attempting another check to discover more information. This can sometimes work, but you should adjust the difficulty to be higher for each follow-up attempt. Once a hero has attempted an incredibly hard check or failed a check, further attempts are fruitless—the hero has recalled everything they know about the subject.</p><p>Information on using Recall Knowledge to identify monsters is in the @UUID[JournalEntry.OxJPjPEL0hZAvHw2.JournalEntryPage.ZVyi2AkmgpWOHvSq]{Creatures} handout.</p><hr /><h3>Sense Direction (Survival)</h3><p>Pick the most appropriate @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]{Simple DC} when someone uses Survival to Sense Direction.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) determine a cardinal direction using the sun</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) find an overgrown path in a forest</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) navigate a hedge maze</p><hr /><h3>Social Skills</h3><p>When a hero uses Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation to influence or impress someone whose level or Will DC you don’t know, estimate the level of the creature and use that DC. A commoner’s level is usually 0 or 1. Don’t worry about being exact. It often makes sense to adjust the DC based on the target’s attitude, using one of the easy DC adjustments if the creature is more friendly or a hard DC adjustment if they dislike the hero. Remember that NPCs aren’t robots. If they’d be unlikely to do something, you can make the DC harder or even impossible!</p><hr /><h3>Swim (Athletics)</h3><p>Use @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]{Simple DCs} based on how turbulent the water is.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) lake or other still water</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) flowing water, like a river</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) swiftly flowing river</p><hr /><h3>Track (Survival)</h3><p>Pick a @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]{Simple DC}. You can adjust the DC to Track based on weather, terrain, and other factors.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) the path of a large army following a road</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear across the tundra</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) a nimble panther’s tracks through a jungle, tracks obscured by rainfall</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"x3B30n5dtJ8XNUnz","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.KK8PMGKZe2sLnhCS.JournalEntryPage.LS1kzZXx1nhGnXRu"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.0-alpha1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662413160101,"lastModifiedBy":"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r"}},{"_id":"67xrow8BHnKbKozv","name":"Introduction","folder":"m7C21c2oeaa6k1lD","sort":100000,"flags":{"pf2e-beginner-box":{"isBB":true},"pf2e-abomination-vaults":{"isAV":true}},"pages":[{"name":"Introduction","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>The First Adventure</h1><p>\"Menace under Otari\" is designed to teach new Game Masters and players how to play Pathfinder.

These can be the pregenerated iconic characters or new heroes of your own creation.</p><p>Because the PF2E system on Foundry adapts the full version of the rules, we have at times simplified our rules references so that the advice and indications in these journals are consistent with both the mechanical implementation of the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset by its Foundry development team and the rules outlined within the Beginner Box. The full variant rules that are used by Pathfinder Society for the Beginner Box are still available in your PDF.</p><p>Because of our changes, we have included additional guidance for those seeking to meet these requirements for Organised Play below.</p><h3>Playing With Pregenerated Characters</h3><p>The easiest option is to use pregenerated heroes, which Paizo recommends within their guidance as improving the immersion of players within the story. If you do so, please make sure that you have imported the Beginner Box version of the pregens from the \"Non-iconic Pregens\" compendium. These are the same character sheets which are included in the Beginner Box.</p><p>The iconic characters as they are presented in other Paizo products, which are contained in the \"Iconics\" compendium, would <em>not</em> qualify for Pathfinder Society credits.</p><h3>Creating Your Own Characters</h3><p>If you would like to make your own hero for Pathfinder Society play, we suggest consulting the rules as contained within the Beginner's Box PDF that was included with your purchase of this module to ensure that you are compliant.

It's a good place to start a Pathfinder campaign, and you can use it as an example of how to create a settlement for your heroes to call home as they start their adventures.</p><h1>Otari</h1><p>Otari is a thriving, diverse lumber town and trade port with a storied past and its fair share of sinister secrets. Founded by a group of adventurers over 400 years ago, the town has weathered attacks from kobolds and strange monsters, economic woes and windfalls, and cycles of prosperity and strife. Today, the town is a prosperous community and one of the largest settlements along the coast, but outside groups have their eye on Otari's fortunes, and centuries-old threats still lie buried beneath the cobblestones!</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/view-of-otari.webp\" width=\"650\" title /></figure><p>Otari is nestled in a coastal valley between two looming cliffs. The Osprey River flows into the sea in the middle of this valley, and the sturdy stone to either side of this river supports hundreds of buildings and a deep harbor. Otari rarely floods, but the numerous caves, warrens, and channels dug beneath the town do so regularly.</p><p>Though day-to-day life in Otari resembles that in any small town, its skyline stands out due to the enormous waterwheel at its eastern edge, the ingenious and enormous flume that brings lumber down the cliffside for easy transportation, and a stunning library to the west. The town's location near a major highway and its long history as a home to various adventuring parties lead visitors and travelers alike to seek it out. Lively trade passing through means unusual wares (and even magic items) aren't too difficult to find.</p><h2>Demographics</h2><p>Just over 1,200 people live in Otari, drawn from all over the world. While most of these residents are humans, some dwarves and elves also live here. Most residents work in the local fishing and lumber industries. For the most part, people in Otari are friendly and welcoming, though they prefer its small-town feel and make lighthearted fun of visitors from big cities. Coffee is a mainstay, a favorite drink among the hardworking and early-rising townsfolk.</p><p>The current mayor of Otari is @UUID[JournalEntry.mbia2YRWQeDkcOou.JournalEntryPage.lL5Ksyb9UXzmwntc]{Oseph Menhemes}, patriarch of one of three local lumber companies and owner of Otari’s famous lumber flume and mill. Though dedicated to his role as a public servant, Oseph is ambitious and wants to expand the town’s lumber-processing capacities.</p><h2>Trade</h2><p>The biggest business in Otari is lumber, and three families control the industry. The largest operator is Otari Lumber, owned by Mayor Oseph Menhemes, which operates the massive @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.awbRaMc6YsidBT9U]{The Giant's Wheel} and the @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.awbRaMc6YsidBT9U#the-loading-flume]{The Loading Flume}. Whistledown Cutters is Otari’s most financially successful lumber company due to the cunning business sense of its owner, Alymora Inkleholtz. Chertel Timber, the third company, has recently struggled due to a combination of poor management, labor issues in its lumber camps, and difficulties with financing.</p><p>All three lumber companies have a not-so-secret enemy in the Kortos Consortium, an externally based organization that wants to control the timber industry in Otari and many nearby communities. The Kortos Consortium isn’t above sabotage or worse to seize control of local interests. Heroes might find work for any of these lumber companies, often against the others!</p><h2>Local Connections</h2><p>A good way to connect heroes who grew up in or near Otari to the town is through their backgrounds.</p><p>Heroes with the acolyte background might have served in the @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.4RBhHJexfKEzEr1q]{Dawnflower Library} and perhaps tended the @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.7c1xklHgZWJSB6y7]{Otari Graveyard}, or they might have had a less-regulated religious upbringing with Magiloy at @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.VEIze2Oj0ECYAETV]{Crow's Casks}.</p><p>Heroes with the criminal background might know @UUID[JournalEntry.mbia2YRWQeDkcOou.JournalEntryPage.fU2bMcFTUsqOxbVr]{Yinyasmera} and be former (or current!) members of the @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.Q6PSJB3KBu9KvlUJ]{Osprey Club}.</p><p>Deckhands or gamblers probably know @UUID[JournalEntry.mbia2YRWQeDkcOou.JournalEntryPage.jETVN9h0a5MupyxS]{Tamily Tanderveil} at the @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.YscCX6Wrt1ZTiyhk]{Otari Fishery}, even though she hasn’t been in town long.</p><p>Scholars have likely studied alongside @UUID[JournalEntry.mbia2YRWQeDkcOou.JournalEntryPage.ANmmxft31H8jaHPU]{Morlibint} at @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.WaTS64VXGBr4ZkPW]{Odd Stories}.</p><p>Warriors might have served in the @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw.JournalEntryPage.GE1QVic4MyVIwWzy]{Otari Guard} under @UUID[JournalEntry.mbia2YRWQeDkcOou.JournalEntryPage.AkfhU9sz4aQhw8B6]{Lardus Longsaddle} (or his better-liked predecessor) or worked as muscle for one of the local lumber companies.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"cVR0TZssJiA8hcjK","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"title":{"show":false,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Story Seeds","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" title /><h2>Using Otari in your campaign</h2><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw]{Otari Locations}</p></header><article><p>The Otari scene included with this world can serve as a map of the town.</p><p>More information on the town's key locations is included in the pinned journals.

Here are possible encounters and seeds for larger stories.</p><h3>A Bad Day at the Market</h3><p>Laborers laying the foundation for an expansion to the Otari Market unearth a nest of giant centipedes that spill into the market stalls and must be exterminated. The centipedes' lair connects to a disused sewer system, where a group of goblins are planning a sneaky raid on the market. If the heroes act quickly, they can catch the goblin thieves by surprise.</p><h3>The Fire God</h3><p>An arsonist captured by the Otari Guard insists that her crimes were commanded by a divine being she met in the ruins of a building that had burned down year earlier. The building contains a hell hound, cinder rats, and a creature of shimmering fire who claims to be a god. This “god” is the malevolent ghost of an actor who died in the earlier fire and hopes to deceive the living.</p><h3>Grim Harvest</h3><p>Two acolytes from the Dawnflower Library are acting suspiciously, opening the graves in the Otari Graveyard they’re supposed to be tending. Investigation shows the acolytes have been murdered and replaced by doppelgangers. They’ve been exhuming the graves to feed a gluttonous band of ghouls, who lair within a mausoleum the doppelgangers have filled with traps and other dangers. If the heroes defeat the ghouls, they recover a strange idol the ghouls used to command the doppelgangers; the heroes can then use the idol to discover who else in town has been replaced.</p><figure class=\"right flipx\"><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/portraits-bestiary/brine-shark.webp\" width=\"120\" /></figure><h3>Honor of Thieves</h3><p>At Crook’s Nook, a brine shark elemental leaps right into the tavern from one of the trapdoors. The heroes are on hand to defeat it, earning the gratitude of the Osprey Club. The thieves decide to thank the heroes by committing minor crimes against the heroes’ rivals (or anyone they perceive to be the heroes’ rivals) and give the heroes the “credit.” These gestures undoubtedly land the heroes in trouble with Lardus Longsaddle, and the heroes must clear up the confusion.</p><h3>Under the Thirsty Alpaca</h3><p>The Thirsty Alpaca’s collapse was inadvertently caused by a tribe of kobolds digging out tunnels beneath it while seeking treasures they believed were still hidden there. Their biggest mistake was allying with a gang of pugwampi gremlins, whose ill luck caused the collapse. The surviving kobolds try to keep townspeople away from the ruins with their spooky tricks and traps. The kobolds seek to re-excavate the passages and also fight against the surviving gremlins, who have decided to betray them! The PCs could try to negotiate a truce, evict both the kobolds and the gremlins, or find another solution.</p><h3>Wrin's Surprise Gift</h3><p>While meeting with the heroes, Wrin Sivinxi receives a large, unlabeled package. She opens it to reveal animated armor that runs amok. After the heroes stop it, Wrin asks them to track down the person who shipped it. Their investigation leads to a ship at the harbor, where an old enemy of Wrin’s is hiding out with her hobgoblin warrior bodyguards.</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/harpy-ambush.webp\" width=\"650\" /></figure><h1>More Adventures in Otari</h1><p>The adventure in this book and the story seeds above aren’t the only adventures this town offers. The standalone Pathfinder Adventure Troubles in Otari continues the story begun here and brings heroes all the way to 5th level.

Typically in Pathfinder, a single grid square is equal to 5 feet, the space a Medium creature (like each of the heroes) would occupy. Small creatures also occupy this space, but typically have tokens scaled down just slightly by the Pathfinder System to give a visual cue of their smaller size. Large creatures occupy a space of 2x2 squares, and each size increments this space by 1 in both dimensions.</p>\n<p>Foundry VTT provides a number of ways to move a controlled token, but the most common is to use the arrow keys on your keyboard or to click and drag the token from one position to another. During encounters or other times when movement is limited, you can measure your movements by holding the ctrl key, clicking your token, and placing waypoints on the way to your destination by clicking as many times as you'd like. This will display a measurement of the distance that move would cover. Pressing the space bar while the measurement is visible will execute the move, and your token will progress through the way points to your destination.</p>\n</article>\n</section>\n<h2>Difficult Terrain</h2>\n<p>Whenever creatures need to cross terrain that’s hard to move through, such as snow or underbrush, you can use the rules for difficult terrain. Difficult terrain costs 5 more feet of movement to move into.</p>\n<h2>Reactions to Movement</h2>\n<p>Some reactions are triggered by a creature using an action with the move trait. The most notable example is Attack of Opportunity, which fighters and some monsters have. A creature with Attack of Opportunity can use it when a nearby enemy uses an action with the move trait or when an enemy leaves a nearby square. The Step basic action doesn’t trigger reactions based on movement and neither does movement caused by other creatures, like a Shove.</p>\n<h2>Moving Through a Creature</h2>\n<p>You can move through the space of any creature willing to let you. If you want to move through an unwilling creature’s space, you can Tumble Through that creature’s space using Acrobatics. You can’t end your turn in a square occupied by another creature, though you can end a move action in its square provided that you immediately use another move action to leave that square. If two creatures end up in the same square by accident, the GM determines which one is forced out of the square (or whether one falls over and gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone condition}).</p>\n<p>You can stand in the same square as a prone creature if that creature is willing, unconscious, or dead and is your size or smaller. The GM might allow you to climb atop a larger creature that’s dead or unconscious in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Falling</h2>\n<p>When you fall more than 5 feet, upon landing you take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a fall, you fall over and gain the prone condition.</p>\n<p>You can Grab an Edge as a reaction to reduce the damage from some falls. Roll a Reflex save against the DC to Climb the surface (as chosen by the GM). If you succeed, you catch yourself and take damage as though the fall were 20 feet shorter (or 30 feet shorter on a critical success). On a critical failure, you take 10 bludgeoning damage for every 20 feet you’ve fallen, then keep falling!</p>\n<section class=\"character-creation\">\n<article><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/movement-example.webp\" /></article>\n<article>\n<h2>Moving on a Grid</h2>\n<p>When a character moves on a grid, every square of the play area is 5 feet across in the game world.</p>\n<p>Because moving diagonally covers more ground, you count that movement differently. The first square of diagonal movement you make in a turn counts as 5 feet, but the second counts as 10 feet, and your count thereafter alternates between the two. </p>\n<p>In this example, Valeros Strides so he can move up to his Speed, which is 25 feet. He moves 5 feet horizontally, then his first diagonal costs 5 more feet. Now his second diagonal costs 10 feet! For the last square of movement, taking another diagonal would take 5 feet, but moving horizontally into the rubble would take 10 feet because the rubble is difficult terrain.

Text that is formatted using italics refers to a spell or magic item, such as <em>light </em>or a <em>healing potion</em>, to help make it instantly recognizable.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>You'll see game terms like \"saving throw\" and \"Hit Points\" as you create a hero and start playing the game. You need only a general idea of these terms for now, and they’re explained more later on.</p>\n<h3>Armor Class (AC)</h3>\n<p>This number is the Difficulty Class for an attack. It represents how hard it is to hit a hero or a monster in combat.</p>\n<h3>Attack</h3>\n<p>When a creature tries to harm another creature, it makes a Strike or uses some other attack action. A success on the roll for that action is called a hit, and a critical success is sometimes called a critical hit. A hero might Strike with a weapon or their fist, grapple with their hands, or attack with a spell. Attacking more than once on your turn gets harder with each attack, giving you a penalty called a multiple attack penalty.</p>\n<h3>Bonuses and Penalties</h3>\n<p>Bonuses and penalties apply to checks and certain statistics. There are several types of bonuses and penalties. If you have more than one bonus of the same type, you use only the highest one. Likewise, you use only the worst penalty of each type.</p>\n<h3>Condition</h3>\n<p>An ongoing effect that changes how a creature can act, or that alters some of their statistics, is called a condition.</p>\n<h3>Durations</h3>\n<p>Some actions have effects that last longer than the actions themselves. These effects are measured by a duration. Something might last until the end of your next turn, for 1 minute, or for other lengths. Once the duration is over, the effect ends.</p>\n<p>When a duration is measured in rounds, the remaining duration decreases by 1 at the start of each turn of the creature that created the effect. If you need to track something that lasts 1 minute in combat, 1 minute is 10 rounds. Most fights don’t last that long, so you might not need to worry about it! Some durations last until certain things happen or stop happening, instead of a certain amount of time.</p>\n<h3>Feat</h3>\n<p>A feat is an ability your hero can use. It might come from their ancestry, background, or class. Some feats grant the ability to use special actions.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points (HP)</h3>\n<p>Hit Points represent how badly injured a creature can be before it falls unconscious and begins dying. Damage decreases Hit Points on a 1-to-1 basis, while healing restores Hit Points at the same rate.</p>\n<h3>Level</h3>\n<p>A level is a number that measures overall power. The rules in this book can take a hero to 3rd level, and those in the Core Rulebook elevate them into living legends all the way to 20th level! Spells, items, and other rules elements also have levels, telling you how powerful they are compared to one another.</p>\n<h3>Nonplayer Character (NPC)</h3>\n<p>A nonplayer character is controlled by the GM. NPCs interact with players and help advance the story.</p>\n<h3>Perception</h3>\n<p>Perception measures your hero's ability to notice hidden objects or unusual situations and usually determines how quickly they spring into action in combat.</p>\n<h3>Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Proficiency measures your hero’s aptitude for each statistic and adds a bonus to that statistic. It has three ranks: untrained, trained, and expert. If you're untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0. If you’re trained, your proficiency bonus equals your level plus 2, and if you’re an expert, your proficiency bonus equals your level plus 4.</p>\n<h3>Round</h3>\n<p>A round is a period of time during an encounter in which all participants get a chance to act. A combat round represents approximately 6 seconds in the world of the game.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throw (Save)</h3>\n<p>Some dangerous effects let you attempt a saving throw to mitigate their harm. You attempt a saving throw automatically—you don’t have to use an action or a reaction. There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (to resist diseases, poisons, and physical effects), Reflex (to evade effects a creature could quickly dodge), and Will (to resist effects that target the mind and personality).</p>\n<h3>Basic Saving Throw</h3>\n<p>Some spells use a \"basic saving throw\". These work like any other save but use the same degrees of success:</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> The creature takes no damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The creature takes half the listed damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure: </strong>The creature takes the full listed damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> The creature takes double the listed damage.</p>\n<h3>Speed</h3>\n<p>Speed is the distance a creature can move using a single action.</p>\n<h3>Trait</h3>\n<p>A trait is a keyword that appears on an action so other rules can interact with it by referencing the trait. For instance, a fighter can make an Attack of Opportunity against someone who uses an action with the manipulate or move trait, and an abjurer wizard can prepare an extra spell with the abjuration trait. Traits appear in boxes beneath the title of a rules element, or in parentheses following an action in a stat block.</p>"},"_id":"RBPfU0F3hH2ghEgf","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":150000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Vo4bKLdIhYczUUbi.JournalEntryPage.7SisBdfkid32oUk1"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Damage","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<figure class=\"head\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/troll-battle.webp\" width=\"650\" /></figure>\n<p>If you make an attack and it hits, or if you successfully cast a spell to harm your foe, you’ll roll dice to determine how much you hurt an enemy. Roll the kind and number of dice indicated by your weapon or spell, and add any numbers listed for that ability (for example, many weapons say to add your Strength to the damage for melee Strikes).</p>\n<p>The damage you deal has a type, such as piercing or fire, which can matter since some creatures take more or less damage depending on the type.</p>\n<p>Damage you deal decreases the target’s Hit Points by the same amount, so a creature that takes 6 damage loses 6 Hit Points. If penalties to an attack would reduce its damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage. For example, if you threw a dagger and rolled a 1 on the damage roll while you had a –1 penalty to damage rolls, you still deal 1 damage to your target.</p>\n<h2>Doubling and Halving</h2>\n<p>You might need to double or halve your damage, depending on the action you used. For instance, many spells deal half damage if your enemy succeeds at its save, full damage if it fails, and double damage if it critically fails. You double or halve the damage after rolling rather than changing the number of dice you roll. Add any bonuses or penalties before you double or halve. Special damage—like the extra damage from a rogue’s sneak attack—is doubled or halved, too. If you halve damage that’s an odd number, round down.</p>\n<h2>Persistent Damage</h2>\n<p>Persistent damage, like bleeding or being on fire, hurts you over time. When you gain persistent damage, you don’t take it right away. Instead, you take it at the end of your turn each round. After you take the damage, you attempt a DC 15 flat check (roll a 15 or higher on a d20 without adding anything) to see if you recover from the persistent damage.</p>\n<h2>Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances</h2>\n<p>Damage might affect a creature differently if it has an immunity, weakness, or resistance to that damage type. Immunity prevents the creature from taking any damage at all. A weakness causes the creature to increase damage they take by the listed amount, and resistance prevents the listed amount of damage. So if you used a spell that deals 10 fire damage, a creature that’s immune to fire would take no damage, a creature with weakness 5 to fire would lose 15 Hit Points, and a creature with resistance 5 to fire would lose 5 Hit Points. This adjustment applies to every instance of damage, so if you made three Strikes that deal bludgeoning damage against a creature with resistance 5 to bludgeoning damage, it would take 5 less damage from each of the three strikes! Usually, heroes don’t have immunities or weaknesses, though the resist energy wizard spell can give resistance to some damage types.</p>\n<p>Immunity matters for more than just damage. A creature that’s immune to a certain trait is completely unaffected by anything with that trait, and one with immunity to a condition can’t gain that condition. For instance, a creature without a mind lists “mental” in its immunities. Not only would it take no mental damage, but a spell with the mental trait wouldn’t do anything to it at all! In some cases, a creature is immune to part of an attack or spell but not the rest, and the GM determines whether this is the case. For instance, if you hit a monster that’s immune to fire with a flaming sword, the sword itself would still deal slashing damage, but the extra fire damage wouldn’t do anything.</p>\n<h2>Damaging Items</h2>\n<p>The rules for attacking and damaging items differ from the rules for creatures. Attacks and spells don’t normally damage items, except for traps, unless specified otherwise. If you have a shield, it can take damage if you use the Shield Block reaction.</p>\n<section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" />\n<h2>Applying Damage in Foundry</h2>\n</header>\n<article>\n<p>Beneath any damage roll in chat, you'll see a row of buttons that allow you to easily apply damage to selected tokens. While you have a token selected, pressing the \"<strong>damage</strong>\", \"<strong>double</strong>\", or \"<strong>half</strong>\" buttons will apply that much damage.

Pathfinder has many types of checks, from skill checks to attack rolls to saving throws, but they all follow the basic steps explained below: roll the d20, calculate your result, and compare that result to a target number called a difficulty class (DC) to determine whether you succeed or fail.</p><p>All checks use the same formula:</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">d20 + statistic + bonuses and penalties = result</p><p>Checks and DCs both come in many forms. When you swing a sword at a monster, you’ll make an attack roll, and its Armor Class is the DC. If you leap across a chasm, you’ll attempt an Athletics skill check with a DC based on how far you’re trying to jump. When trying to remember information about an ancient text, you’ll roll a skill check to Recall Knowledge with a skill and DC determined by the GM.</p><p>These are some common types of checks and DCs:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Check</th><th>Statistic</th><th>Difficulty Class (DC)</th></tr><tr><td>Weapon or fist attack</td><td>Attack bonus</td><td>Armor Class (AC) of the target</td></tr><tr><td>Spell attack</td><td>Spell attack roll</td><td>Armor Class (AC) of the target</td></tr><tr><td>Saving throw against a spell</td><td>Fortitude, Reflex, or Will</td><td>Spell DC of the caster</td></tr><tr><td>Perception check</td><td>Perception</td><td>Stealth DC of a hiding creature or DC set by the GM to find an object in the environment</td></tr><tr><td>Stealth check</td><td>Stealth Skill</td><td>Perception DC of observers</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Rolling a Check</h1><section class=\"character-creation\"><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 1: Roll</h2><p>Start by rolling your d20! Pay attention to whether you rolled a 20 or a 1 on the die because that does something special when you determine success or failure.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 2: Calculate the Result</h2><p>Add the number you rolled on the d20 to the statistic you’re using (such as your attack bonus or your Stealth), and add any special bonuses and penalties that apply. This total is your result.</p><h3>Bonuses and Penalties</h3><p>Sometimes you’ll have a bonus or penalty to add to your roll in addition to the statistic you’re using. For instance, a spell might give you a bonus to an attack roll. Such a bonus might be labeled, like a circumstance bonus, status bonus, or item bonus. You can benefit from only the highest bonus with a given label. For example, if two spells are affecting you, each giving you a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, your total status bonus would still just be +1, not +2. This works the same way for multiple circumstance or item bonuses, too. But if you get a +1 status bonus and a +1 circumstance bonus to an attack roll, you add both! Penalties can have labels too, and they work the same way, except that the number is negative.</p><p>Anything without a label is cumulative. For example, the penalty for making multiple attacks in a round and the penalty for attacking at a long range with a ranged weapon don’t have labels, so both would apply to an attack that wasn’t your first of the round and was made at a long range.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 3: Determine Success</h2><p>Often, it’s important to determine not only if you succeed or fail, but also how spectacularly you succeed or fail. Exceptional results can cause you to critically succeed or critically fail.</p><p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You exceed the DC by 10 or more.</p><p><strong>Success: </strong>You meet or exceed the DC.</p><p><strong>Failure: </strong>Your result is lower than the DC.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure: </strong>Your result is lower than the DC by 10 or more.</p><p>The action you’re using tells you what happens depending on how well you rolled. For instance, if you attacked with a Strike, you’d deal double damage on a critical success, the normal amount of damage on a success, and no damage at all on a failure or critical failure. If an action doesn’t say anything special happens on a critical failure, a critical failure has the same result as a regular failure. For a Strike, a critical failure is no different from a regular failure. Likewise, if an action doesn’t say something special happens on a critical success, it has the same effect as a success.</p><h3>Rolling a 20 or a 1</h3><p>Rolling the highest or lowest number on a d20 has some special rules.</p><p><strong>If you roll a 20 on the d20</strong>, use a result one step better than what you’d normally get based on your roll. This changes a critical failure to a failure, a failure to a success, and a success to a critical success. Usually, this means you critically succeed!</p><p><strong>If you roll a 1 on the d20</strong>, do the opposite and use a result one step worse. This changes a critical success to a success, a success to a failure, and a failure to a critical failure. Usually, this means you critically fail.</p></article></section><h3>Calculating DCs</h3><p>For many checks, you’ll compare your result to another creature’s DC, with Strikes, the DC of your attack roll is your target’s Armor Class (AC). Sometimes an enemy’s check uses your DC, like comparing the result of an Intimidation check to Demoralize you to your Will DC. If you need a DC for something that’s normally a statistic, such as a Will DC, just add 10 to the statistic to get the DC. For example, a creature with a Will of +5 has a Will DC of 15.</p><p>For other checks, like an Athletics check to Climb a steep cliff, the Game Master sets the DC for you. They have information on how to do so in the @UUID[JournalEntry.k2bOm2AUnF7u547y.JournalEntryPage.x3B30n5dtJ8XNUnz]{Example DCs} handout.</p><h2>Special Rules for Checks</h2><p>Some types of checks follow special rules.</p><h3>Flat Checks</h3><p>When something’s based purely on chance, you’ll attempt a flat check. A flat check never includes any modifiers, bonuses, or penalties—you just roll a d20 and compare the result on the die to the DC.</p><h3>Secret Checks</h3><p>The secret trait appears on anything that uses secret checks. You use the normal formula for the check, but the GM rolls the d20 in secret. Instead of revealing the result, the GM simply describes the information or effects determined by the check’s result.</p><h3>Helping Someone</h3><p>You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} someone when they attempt a skill check or attack roll to potentially give them a bonus. This requires preparing to help them, usually by spending an action or more on your turn, then using a reaction when they attempt their skill check or attack roll. When you use your reaction, attempt a skill check or attack roll, usually the same type of roll as the one you’re trying to help.</p><h3>Attacks</h3><p>Anything that has the attack trait follows some special rules. You can read about @UUID[.rj7hexKclZx0NA3s]{Attacks} here.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"DyVmklA6nwuY8sgU","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":175000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.NzwJQInn9m18Uh63.JournalEntryPage.nKcDh7C9TY0esBx4"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Attacks","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>You make an attack roll when you Strike and for some other actions. For most attack rolls, you’ll compare your result against your target’s Armor Class (AC). There are three main types of attack rolls: melee attack rolls, ranged attack rolls, and spell attack rolls. Some skills can be used to make attacks, such as Athletics being used to Grapple someone rather than damage them.</p><h3>Multiple Attack Penalty</h3><p>If you attack more than once on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty. This penalty is -5 for your second attack, and -10 for your third and any subsequent attacks. Some abilities or features, such as a weapon's agile trait, reduce your Multiple Attack Penalty.</p><p>Always calculate your multiple attack penalty for the weapon you’re using on that attack. If you attack with a longsword, then a shortsword (which has the agile trait), the attack with the shortsword is at –4, even though your first attack was with a weapon that isn’t agile.</p><p>The penalty resets every turn. It also applies only during your turn, so you don’t have to keep track of it if you can perform an Attack of Opportunity or a similar reaction that lets you make a Strike on someone else’s turn.</p><h3>Range Penalty</h3><p>Ranged and thrown weapons are less accurate against targets farther away. The weapon’s range increment determines this interval. As long as your target is at or within the listed range increment, also called the first range increment, you take no penalty to the attack roll. Beyond that distance, you take a –2 penalty for each additional increment beyond the first. Both the multiple attack penalty and range penalty can apply to the same attack, giving a big penalty to your second or third attack against someone far away!</p><h3>Light and Darkness</h3><p>There are three levels of light: bright light, dim light, and darkness. The game’s rules assume you’re in bright light, so most of the time you don’t have to worry about any special rules. Areas in shadow or lit by weak light sources are in dim light. Creatures and objects in dim light have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition, meaning any attack or other effect that would target them fails unless the creature trying to target them succeeds at a DC 5 flat check (rolling a 5 or higher on a d20 without adding anything).</p><p>A creature with darkvision or low-light vision can see in the dim light and targets creatures in it normally. Areas without any light at all are in darkness. A creature or object in darkness can’t be seen unless the creature looking for it has darkvision. A creature without darkvision or another means of perceiving in darkness is blinded while in darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond the darkness. When you’re blinded, all terrain is difficult terrain and you take a –4 status penalty to Perception checks that rely on sight. If you try to attack or affect a target you can’t see due to darkness or for any other reason, you fail unless you succeed at a DC 11 flat check.</p><p>Some actions have you select one or more specific targets. You can’t select a target if it’s out of range, if you can’t tell where it is, if it doesn’t match restrictions on who you can target, or if some other ability prevents it from being targeted.</p><p>Some effects target an ally. This must be someone on your side, often another hero, but it might be a bystander you’re trying to protect. You aren’t your own ally. If it isn’t clear, the GM decides who counts as an ally or an enemy. An ability that targets a willing creature doesn’t do anything unless the target allows you to affect them. Only you can decide whether your hero is willing, and the GM decides whether an NPC is willing.</p><p>Melee attacks can target someone only if they’re adjacent—right next to the attacker on the grid. Being next to them diagonally on the corner of their space is still adjacent. Some abilities, like the Lunge fighter feat or the enlarge spell, let someone reach creatures further away. Large creatures can always reach creatures up to 10 feet away.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Targeting</h2><p><a class=\"entity-link\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/player-orientation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em class=\"fas fa-book\"> </em>Knowledge Base: Player Orientation</a></p></header><article><p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop provides a simple approach to indicating which enemy or ally a player or GM may be targeting. You can quickly mark your targets by hovering the mouse over a token and pressing <strong>'T'</strong> on your keyboard. To target multiple tokens, a player can hold <strong>shift</strong> while pressing T. This provides a small colored indicated which matches the color a player has been assigned, and makes it easy to see who's targeting what.</p><p>The Pathfinder Second Edition game system also automates a number of options, such as comparing AC to see if your attack should hit, or providing for conditional bonuses such as Sneak Attacks. These automations only function if you have an enemy targeted when you perform your action.</p></article></section><h3>Cover</h3><p>When you’re behind an obstacle that could block weapons, guard you against explosions, and make you harder to detect, you’re behind cover. Standard cover gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, to Reflex saves against area effects, and to Stealth checks to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise avoid detection.</p><p>Creatures give lesser cover, which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. A creature with standard cover can attempt to use the Stealth skill to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide}, but lesser cover isn’t sufficient for using Stealth.</p><p>You might simultaneously have cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you typically can’t target it at all. The GM decides whether you have cover and whether it’s lesser or standard.</p><p>If you and an ally are on opposite sides or corners of an enemy, you’re flanking that enemy. This gives the creature the flat-footed condition (giving it a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) against attacks from anyone flanking it. If you stop flanking the creature, the flat-footed condition ends.</p><p>You can flank or help an ally flank only if you meet all three of the following conditions:</p><p>• No condition or effect is preventing you from acting or attacking.</p><p>• You’re holding melee weapons or able to make a fist attack.</p><p>• You’re close enough to reach the enemy with an attack.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Automated Flanking</h2></header><article><p>The Pathfinder Second Edition game system includes automation of flanking and appropriately enables flanking bonuses for cases where they would apply, removing the need to keep track of it yourself.</p><p>A simple way of understanding how this automation works is to consider that there are two \"teams\", Tokens linked to actors that are owned by players, and tokens whose actors are not.

Some of these actions can be attempted by anyone, but others require a hero to have the trained proficiency rank in the skill (or better).</p><h3>Exploration Activities</h3><p>Some skill activities have the exploration trait. These usually take a minute or more, and can't be used during an encounter. If you're not sure whether you have the time to use one of these activities, ask your GM.</p><h3>Secret Checks</h3><p>If an action has the secret trait, the GM rolls the check for you and tells you what happens without revealing the result of the roll. Secret checks happen when your knowledge is imperfect, like when you’re searching for a hidden creature or object, attempting to deceive someone, or remembering some piece of lore. This way, you as the player don’t know things that your character wouldn’t.</p><h2>Calculating Skill Modifiers</h2><h3>Ability Modifier</h3><p>Every skill uses an ability modifier, which is listed next to the skill- for example, Stealth uses your Dexterity.</p><h3>Proficiency</h3><p>Many of the statistics on your character sheet will include a proficiency bonus. If your hero’s proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, the proficiency bonus for that statistic equals your hero’s level + 2. If it’s expert, the proficiency bonus equals your hero’s level + 4. If your hero is untrained in that statistic, their proficiency bonus is +0.</p><h3>Armor and Skills</h3><p>If you wear armor, you might take a penalty to skills that use your Strength or Dexterity.

It's up to you whether you'd like to play one of those four, or any of the other classes that are available in the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset.</p><p>Once you've decided on the best class for you, you need to apply it to your character. You can do this by clicking on the + icon near the Class field of your character sheet and choosing it from the options there.</p><h2>Class Benefits</h2><p>When you choose a class, your character sheet will automatically be populated with the basic features and benefits granted by your class. Other benefits may require you to make a choice between several options.</p><p>If you ever are uncertain what your class is granting you, you can open your class item and read the full list of features and benefits that it contains from the main tab of your character sheet. However, you may find the way that the information is presented in the core rulebook for Pathfinder Second Edition to be more legible. We will try to offer an overview here, but when in doubt, refer back to the rulebook!</p><h3>Ability Boosts</h3><p>Choosing a class will automatically grant you an ability boost to that class's \"key ability\". For some classes, like Wizard, this is set- for others, you get a choice.</p><p>In addition, at this point you'll also be given the opportunity to take four free ability boosts. These can be to any ability score of your choice, although they must each be assigned to a different ability.</p><p>All of these ability boosts can be managed in the same ways as any other, as outlined in the @UUID[JournalEntry.mrmEfL8tRhGltGJX.JournalEntryPage.lygt82lIvFJVGsUA]{Modifying Ability Scores} journal page.</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p>Your class will grant you training in certain weapons, armor, and skills. These can be viewed from the \"skills\" tab of your character sheet.</p><p>In addition, your class will grant you the ability to choose a number of additional skills and languages. We'll make these choices later, during the @UUID[JournalEntry.KIpNnMtah73eyPC8.JournalEntryPage.BEtnPZeVzTcELPDf]{Finishing your Hero} section, but don't forget about them!</p><h3>Features</h3><p>The \"features\" tab of your character sheet is where class features and class feats will appear. Once you add your class, the basic features will be listed here, and more will populate this tab as your character levels up. Take a moment to familiarise yourself with them.</p><p>Some classes can choose class feats immediately at level 1, while others will have to wait until later. As with Ancestry feats, a slot will appear for them when you have a new choice to make.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Some classes are spellcasters, which means that they'll need to use the Spells tab of their character sheet. </p><p>Creating spellcasting entries and adding spells to them is not something that the system will do automatically for you. However, the rules that detail how your character interacts with magic and how their spellcasting works will be included in the class feature that granted you spellcasting. From there, you should be able to populate your Spells tab. </p><p>Choosing spells can be one of the most exciting parts of playing a spellcaster. When you have a spellcasting entry, you can click the magnifying glass icon to open the Compendium Browser to a pre-filtered list of spells that are valid choices for that level. Do note though that, unless your GM gives you special permission, you probably can't choose any of the options with a rarity of Uncommon or higher!</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"name":"Classes","folder":"gWYQ6AssXJE1noqA","sort":-325000,"ownership":{"default":0,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"flags":{"pf2e-beginner-box":{"isBB":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.0-alpha1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1659632550005,"modifiedTime":1662224194166,"lastModifiedBy":"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r"},"_id":"DIxKe5DDC3mb4EFt"},{"folder":"LblI3YBfHwUEF4jt","name":"Encounters","pages":[{"name":"Creatures","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<figure class=\"head\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/ezren-snake.webp\" width=\"650\" title /></figure><p>Creatures range from the mundane to the extraordinary, from dragons to wolves. While they’re most often opponents in combat, creatures can provide interesting situations outside of encounters.</p><h2>Reading Creature Statistics</h2><p>Each creature’s statistics appear on their character sheet. You can find these in the Actors tab of your sidebar- here is the @UUID[Actor.r9w1n85mp9Ip4QiS]{Kobold Warrior} as an example.</p><p>These sheets include a lot of information about a creature, some of which is very similar to how player characters work. A few key points are:</p><ul><li><p>The top of a creature’s stat block lists its name and its level. While heroes start at 1st level, some weak creatures can be level 0 or even level -1.</p></li><li><p>Underneath the name is the creature’s traits line. All creatures will have a rarity, an alignment, and a size. The creature’s other traits are then listed alphabetically.</p></li><li><p>The stat block also lists all the actions and abilities the creature can use other than the basic actions available to every creature. Action icons note how many actions an ability requires.</p></li><li><p>Some creatures have spells or equipment, which are included in the other tabs of their character sheet.</p></li></ul><h3>Creature Size</h3><p>Creatures can be Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large. Medium creatures, like the heroes, take up one square on a grid, as do Small creatures. Up to four Tiny creatures can fit in one square, and a Tiny creature can share a square with a Small or larger creature. Large creatures take up a 2 × 2 area.</p><h2>Choosing Monster Actions</h2><p>As the GM, you roleplay monsters and choose their tactics. Players often coordinate and plan to be as efficient as possible, but monsters might not! Most creatures have a basic grasp of simple tactics like flanking or focusing on a single target. But remember that they also react based on emotions and make mistakes! Some creatures have only animal intelligence or are mindless, and you should play them that way.</p><p>Monsters usually don’t attack a hero who’s knocked out. Even if a creature knows a fallen hero might come back into the fight, only the most vicious creatures focus on helpless foes rather than the more immediate threats around them.</p><h2>Identifying Creatures</h2><p>The Recall Knowledge action can be used to identify a creature. The DC is based on the creature’s level.</p><p>The skill used depends on that creature’s most important trait, as shown below. A hero who identifies a creature learns one of its abilities—such as a troll’s regeneration. On a critical success, the hero also learns a second detail that’s less commonly known, like the trigger for the creature’s reaction.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Creature Trait</th><th>Description</th><th>Skill to Identify</th></tr><tr><td>Aberration</td><td><div><p>Strange corruptions of the natural order</p></div></td><td>Occultism</td></tr><tr><td>Animal</td><td><div><p>Mundane animals with low Intelligence</p></div></td><td>Nature</td></tr><tr><td>Beast</td><td><div><p>Creatures similar to animals but more intelligent</p></div></td><td>Nature, Arcana</td></tr><tr><td>Construct</td><td><div><p>Artificial creatures, neither living nor undead</p></div></td><td>Crafting, Arcana</td></tr><tr><td>Dragon</td><td><div><p>Reptilian creatures, often with wings and a breath weapon</p></div></td><td>Arcana</td></tr><tr><td>Elemental</td><td><div><p>Creatures directly tied to air, earth, fire or water</p></div></td><td>Arcana, Nature</td></tr><tr><td>Fey</td><td><div><p>Creatures of the First World</p></div></td><td>Nature</td></tr><tr><td>Humanoid</td><td><div><p>Intelligent creatures, typically bipedal with two arms</p></div></td><td>Society</td></tr><tr><td>Ooze</td><td><div><p>Creatures with simple, usually malleable anatomies</p></div></td><td>Occultism</td></tr><tr><td>Undead</td><td><div><p>Creatures infused after death with soul-corrupting evil magic</p></div></td><td>Religion</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"_id":"ZVyi2AkmgpWOHvSq","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.SMSdqNDuTRqYHYSJ.JournalEntryPage.LOSMDBufgczAEv3R"}},"title":{"show":false,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Hazards","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<figure class=\"head\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/pit-peril.webp\" width=\"650\" title /></figure><p>Dungeons are rife with devious traps meant to protect the treasures within, ranging from devices that shoot darts to those that drop heavy blocks or expose hidden pit traps.</p><p>While hazards are often encountered during @UUID[JournalEntry.xsFyTuQjIqtbqONX]{Exploration}, they can also be a complication during a @UUID[.ZFjG6Np42VRz5hFu#combat-encounters]{Combat Encounter} with creatures, or even be the subject of an entire encounter of their own. To learn more about how to use hazards in your game, keep reading!</p><h2>Running Hazards</h2><h3>Detecting a Hazard</h3><p>Every hazard has a trigger of some kind, like a trip wire or a pressure plate. When characters approach a hazard, they have a chance of finding the mechanism before triggering the hazard. During exploration, determine whether the party detects a hazard when the heroes first enter the area in which it appears. Only someone actively searching (using the Search activity while exploring or the Seek action in an encounter) has a chance to notice them. Anyone who succeeds becomes aware of the hazard, and you can describe what they notice.</p><h3>Triggering a Hazard</h3><p>If the group fails to detect a hazard and the hazard’s trigger depends on a standard part of traveling (such as stepping on a floor plate), the hazard’s reaction occurs. Hazards that would be triggered only when someone directly manipulates the environment—by opening a door, for example—use their reactions only if a hero explicitly takes that action.</p><h3>Disabling a Hazard</h3><p>The most versatile method for deactivating traps is the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill. The DC is listed in the hazard’s stat block. As noted in skills, a creature must be trained in Thievery to use the Disable a Device action. Fully disarming some traps requires multiple successful Disable a Device actions. For example, disabling scythe blades requires a successful check on each of two blades. A critical failure on any roll to disable a hazard triggers it.</p><p>A character must first detect a hazard (or have it pointed out to them) to try to deactivate it. They can attempt to deactivate a hazard whether or not it has already been triggered, though most hazards no longer pose a danger once their reactions have occurred.</p><h3>Damaging a Hazard</h3><p>Damaging a trap works like damaging a shield: the trap reduces the damage it takes by its Hardness. If a hazard’s Hit Points are reduced to its Broken Threshold (BT) or lower, the hazard becomes broken and can no longer be activated. If it’s reduced to 0 HP, it’s destroyed and can’t be repaired. Usually, the trap is triggered when attacked, though it isn’t triggered if it’s destroyed in one hit because there’s not enough left to harm anyone! If it’s broken in one hit but not destroyed, you decide whether it triggers based on the type of trap.</p><p>Hazards’ AC, saving throws, Hardness, HP, and BT are listed in their stat blocks. A hazard that doesn’t list one of these statistics can’t be affected by anything targeting that statistic. For example, a hazard that has HP but no BT can’t be broken, but it can still be destroyed. Hazards can be targeted only by things that specifically say they can target objects. Certain abilities like bleed damage, poison, mental effects, and the sickened condition don’t work against a hazard, nor do any other effects that wouldn’t reasonably work on an object.</p><h2>Hazard Experience</h2><p>Characters gain XP for overcoming a hazard, whether they disable it, avoid it, or simply endure its attacks. If they trigger the same hazard later on, they don’t gain XP for the hazard again. The XP a hazard gives depends on the party’s level, as shown below. For example, a 0-level hazard faced by a 1st-level party is worth 6 XP because level 0 is the party’s level -1.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Level</th><th>Simple Hazard</th><th>Complex Hazard</th></tr><tr><td>Party Level -4</td><td>2</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level -3</td><td>3</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level -2</td><td>4</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level -1</td><td>6</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level</td><td>8</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level +1</td><td>12</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level +2</td><td>16</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level +3</td><td>24</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Party Level +4</td><td>30</td><td>150</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"_id":"f82BLxCvoOGIzQ7U","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.TyXs3Gk0DQMSGotS.JournalEntryPage.wg5ojNkARhJq5RNJ"}},"title":{"show":false,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Ending Encounters","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>An encounter typically ends when all the creatures on one side are killed or knocked unconscious.

Once there’s a surrender, come out of initiative order and have the heroes enter into a short negotiation to see whether the winners show mercy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Escape</strong>: Having enemies flee can cause problems. Heroes often want to pursue foes that flee because they think an enemy might return as a threat later on. If you run this round-by-round, your game will get boring quickly! Instead, ask anyone who wants to pursue their fleeing enemy how they pursue. If they use an ability or spell that seems really helpful, and if their Speed isn’t much slower than the escaping enemy, they catch the enemy. If not, the enemy escapes for now unless it’s much slower than the heroes.</p></li></ul><p>If the heroes decide to flee, it’s usually best to let them do so. Pick a particular location on the map and allow them to escape once they all reach it.</p><h3>Bypassed Encounters</h3><p>What happens if you plan a fight or challenge and the heroes find a way to avoid it entirely? This could leave them behind on XP or cause them to miss important information or treasure.</p><p>In the case of XP, the guidelines are simple: If the heroes avoided the challenge with smart thinking and planning, award them the normal XP they would have received!

They often feature combat with other creatures, but they can also include @UUID[.f82BLxCvoOGIzQ7U]{Hazards}, or you might create social challenges in which characters duel only with words. The rules for building challenges appropriate to your group’s level, as well as how to run them, are contained within this journal.</p><p>Some adventures have a clear and direct progression, with challenges occurring at specific times or in a specific order. Others, such as a dungeon filled with interconnected rooms the group can investigate in any order, are nonlinear, and the group can face challenges in any order—or even avoid them entirely. Most adventures are somewhere in between, with some keystone challenges you know the heroes must contend with and some optional ones that the heroes could avoid.</p><h2>Types of Encounter</h2><h3>Combat Encounters</h3><p>The most common type of challenge is a combat encounter, where the heroes fight other creatures. As you plan your adventure, think about the kinds of creatures that fit your story. Not all of them have to be important to the plot. It’s okay to include monsters you think would just be fun to use! Think about your players, too. Include monsters you think they’d like going up against based on the players’ personalities.</p><p>While you’re picking encounters for your adventure, make notes about which area each encounter appears in and details about the creatures involved. This includes notes on their place in the adventure’s plot and any treasure you want them to carry. You can look at the rooms in “Menace under Otari” for the types of information to include, though you can just use brief notes instead of writing everything out in detail.</p><h3>Social Interactions</h3><p>Some conversations and other social interactions are important enough that you should treat them with the same importance as encounters. If major consequences can come from the conversation, success or failure really matters. These interactions should be worth XP. It’s usually a moderate accomplishment, but it might be a major one for something like talking a king out of going to war!</p><p>Social interactions don’t follow the same rules as combat. Roleplay them as a conversation, and have the heroes roll skill checks as appropriate. These are usually Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation, but players might think of something clever, like using Religion to make friends with a local priest. Remember that you can give heroes circumstance bonuses (usually +1 or +2) if their approach is really likely to work on the person they’re talking to.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"ZFjG6Np42VRz5hFu","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":-100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Mu6L6Ei4qHND6Kdn.JournalEntryPage.1aLfwd1MeLjYZGg1"}},"title":{"show":false,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Encounter Budget","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<section class=\"character-creation\"><article class=\"full\"><h1>Table 10-1: Encounter Budget</h1><p>Choose a difficulty for your encounter.

Then, estimate how much of a threat you want the encounter to pose. An encounter has an XP budget. This is how much XP all the monsters in it are worth. This budget depends on how much of a threat the foes are.</p><p>The @UUID[.LhKbKh6JlJKFhwbO]{Encounter Budget} handout has all of the tables you'll need in one place— once you're familiar with the rules, you'll be able to use it to quickly build engaging and balanced encounters. If this is the first time you've built an encounter, though, the steps below will guide you through the process.</p><section class=\"character-creation\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Step 1: Encounter Difficulty</h3><p>Before we can choose the @UUID[.ZVyi2AkmgpWOHvSq]{Creatures} that will appear in our encounter, we'll need to decide how difficult we want the encounter to be. This will tell us our Encounter Budget. You can choose from the list below, or use Table 10-1 on the @UUID[.LhKbKh6JlJKFhwbO]{Encounter Budget} handout.</p><p>• <strong>Low-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 60 XP) use some of the party’s resources, but they aren’t that scary. It would be unlikely (or the result of very poor tactics) for the entire party to be seriously threatened.</p><p>• <strong>Moderate-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 80 XP) are a serious challenge to the heroes, though unlikely to overpower them completely. Heroes usually need to use sound tactics and manage their resources wisely.</p><p>•<strong>Severe-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 120 XP) are the hardest encounters most groups of heroes can consistently defeat. These encounters should be save for important moments in your story, such as confronting a final boss. Bad luck, poor tactics, or lack of resources due to prior encounters can easily turn a severe-threat encounter against the heroes, and a wise group keeps the option to disengage open.</p><p>You might warn the players when they enter a severe fight, especially if they’re new to Pathfinder. Their heroes likely can tell when they’re up against an enemy that looks really tough, even if the players aren’t sure yet!</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Step 2: Spend Your Budget</h3><p>Next, we can use our budget to choose creatures and hazards to populate our encounter. To do this, consult tables 10-3 and 10-4 on the @UUID[.LhKbKh6JlJKFhwbO]{Encounter Budget} handout.</p><p>The Pathfinder Second Edition system includes a huge number of creatures, which are available to you from the system compendiums. You can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pf2e-macros.s2sa8lo9dcIA6UGe]{Compendium Browser} to search the Bestiaries for creatures of the appropriate levels, with the option to filter for certain traits if you want to narrow your search.</p><p>Try to think about the location the encounter is happening, and choose creatures that might appear there or that can make good use of the terrain. The goal is to engage your players and get them to think tactically, while also making the world feel more real.</p><p>Once you've chosen the specific creatures that will constitute your encounter, make sure that you drag them out of the Compendium Browser and into your world. They'll appear in the Actors tab of your sidebar (the silhouette icon). If you'd like, you can also assign them a portrait and token here, although this is entirely optional.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Step 3: Run the Encounter!</h3><p>That's right- that's all it took!

Time is divided into rounds, each of which is 6 seconds of time in the game world. (Ten rounds is 1 minute.) Every round, each creature in that combat takes a turn in an established order called initiative. An encounter takes place following these four steps.</p><section class=\"character-creation\"><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 1: Roll Initiative</h2><p>When the encounter starts, the GM calls for initiative. Roll your Perception (unless you were Avoiding Notice in the lead-up to the battle, in which case you roll Stealth). The GM rolls initiative for anyone other than the heroes in the encounter. Unlike a typical check, where the result is compared to a DC, the results of initiative rolls are ranked from highest to lowest.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 2: Play a Round</h2><p>The round starts with the creature who rolled the highest initiative taking their turn first. The process of taking a turn is described below.</p><p>Once the first creature has taken their turn, the one with the next highest initiative takes their turn, and so on. If initiative results are tied, enemies go before the heroes. If creatures on the same side tie, they choose what order to go the first time their initiative comes up. After that, everyone’s place in the initiative order doesn’t change for the rest of that encounter.</p><p>Once everyone has taken a turn, the round ends, and the next one begins.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 3: Begin the Next Round</h2><p>Initiative is like a clock—after all combatants have taken their turns, you’ll start a new round. Go back to the highest initiative number and everyone takes another turn in the same order in the new round.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 4: End the Encounter</h2><p>When everyone on one side is defeated, some sort of truce is reached, or another event or circumstance stops the combat, the encounter ends. You and the other participants no longer follow the initiative order, and the game returns to exploration.</p><p>At the end of an encounter, the GM may award Experience Points to the party, or you may find treasure to divvy up.</p></article></section><h1>Taking Your Turn</h1><p>When it reaches your initiative in combat, you get to take your turn! You can use your actions on your turn, and some special rules apply at the start and end of your turn. Here’s what you do during each part of your turn.</p><h2>Start of Your Turn</h2><p>• If you created an effect with a duration lasting a certain number of rounds, like many spells do, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. The effect ends if the duration is reduced to 0.</p><p>• If you’re dying, roll a recovery check (see @UUID[JournalEntry.OoPjlnYYGLn5KPZy.JournalEntryPage.SucJycHedcDPml60]{Hit Points, Healing, and Dying}).</p><p>• Lose the reaction from your previous turn, and regain your 3 actions and 1 reaction. You can’t “save up” unused actions or reactions from previous turns. If a condition or effect prevents you from using some, but not all, of your actions, you still regain the remaining actions. If a condition or effect prevents you from using all of your actions, you don’t regain any actions or your reaction.</p><h2>Using Actions</h2><p>• Now that you have your actions, it’s time to use them! You can perform your actions in any order you wish, but you have to complete one before beginning another. For example, you couldn’t Strike while in the middle of a Stride unless a special activity lets you. You can pick your actions from the basic actions available to all characters as well as any actions you get from your class, ancestry, equipment, or any other choices you made during character creation.</p><p>• Once you’re done spending actions, go to the end of your turn.</p><h2>End of Your Turn</h2><p>• Lose any of your 3 actions that remain. You keep your reaction if you didn’t use it on your turn; you lose it at the start of your next turn.</p><p>• If you are suffering from @UUID[JournalEntry.OoPjlnYYGLn5KPZy.JournalEntryPage.9H0Jrj0siUcpFC1s#persistent-damage]{Persistent Damage}, you take the damage at this time. After taking the damage, you can attempt the flat check to end the persistent damage.</p><p>• End any effects that last until the end of your turn.</p><p>• Resolve anything else specified to happen at the end of your turn.</p><p>• Your turn is over, and the next creature’s turn begins.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"hZz7TLxyIJpNZbHF","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.H4hH0Kuwqz9NmgrD.JournalEntryPage.feKAhJOE5woEqEzU"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}}],"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"flags":{"pf2e-beginner-box":{"isBB":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.0-alpha1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1661873548528,"modifiedTime":1662411745493,"lastModifiedBy":"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r"},"_id":"OxJPjPEL0hZAvHw2"},{"folder":"LblI3YBfHwUEF4jt","name":"Exploration","pages":[{"name":"Environments","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Environment rules bring the locales your party travels through to life.

Rubble dense enough to be walked over rather than navigated through requires Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance}as well (DC 15).</p><p>• Sand: Packed sand doesn’t impede movement, but loose sand is difficult terrain. Especially deep or loose sand requires a creature crossing it to use Acrobatics to Balance (DC 20).</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> blinding reflected sunlight, rolling dunes, a mirage, circling vultures</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling winds, cascading sand, insects at night</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> dust, desert herbs</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> coarse sand, warm rock, dry brush</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> direct heat, dust devil, sandstorm</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Forest</h3><p>These environments include jungles and other wooded areas.</p><p>• Trees: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a tree (DC 15). Trees that take up an entire 5-foot square on the map (or more) are big enough to provide standard cover; narrower trees don’t.</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Heavy undergrowth gives standard cover to anyone in it, but it’s even harder to move through. Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement, not just 5!</p><p>• Vines: Acrobatics or Athletics skill to swing on a vine (DC 15).</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> towering trees, dense undergrowth, verdant canopies, colorful wildlife, dappled sunlight through the trees, mossy tree trunks, twisted roots</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling leaves, snapping branches, animal calls</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> decomposing vegetation, flowering plants, pine trees, earthy mushrooms</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> leaves crunching underfoot, scraping branches, water dripping from above, rough bark</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> still air, cool shade, sporadic breeze, rain on the canopy, branches coated in thick snow</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Mountain</h3><p>Mountain environments also include hills, which share many aspects of mountains, though not their more extreme features.</p><p>• Chasms: Athletics to make a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump} across a chasm or similar natural pit (DC 15 for a chasm 10 feet across; add 5 to the DC for every 5 feet wider). Failing to make the jump means taking bludgeoning damage from the fall equal to half the distance fallen. Alternatively, creatures can take the safer but slower route of Climbing down the near side of the chasm and then ascending the far side to get across. Good depths for chasms are 30 feet or 50 feet. Much deeper, and the fall is likely to kill a hero!</p><p>• Cliffs and Slopes: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a cliff (DC 10 for sloped cliffs, 15 for steep cliffs, or 20 for sheer cliffs or steep ones with few handholds). Without extensive safety precautions, such as having a creature farther up secure a rope, a critical failure can result in significant falling damage.</p><p>• Lava: A volcano might have small lava flows. Just the heat from being near lava is harmful, dealing 1d6 fire damage each round to anyone within 10 feet. Going into the lava is almost certain death for anyone not immune to fire. It deals 20d6 fire damage every round!</p><p>• Rubble and Scree: Difficult terrain. Especially deep or pervasive rubble requires Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} as well (DC 15).</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Thick undergrowth on mountains is rare and follows the rules found under forests.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> bare cliffs, snow caps, hardy trees, slopes littered with scree, fallen rocks, birds flying on currents, fog among the peaks</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> howling wind, falling rocks, clear echoes, crunch of rocks underfoot, distant avalanche</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> blowing dust, pine trees, fresh snow</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> rough stone, powdery snow, unstable rubble</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> swirling clouds, chill of high altitude, direct sunlight, powerful wind and rain</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Plains</h3><p>The plains environment encompasses grasslands, such as savannas and farmland. Such terrain is usually fairly flat and easy to traverse.</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Thick undergrowth in plains is rare (usually planted hedges or tall crops like corn) and follows the rules found under forests.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> grass waving gently, scattered wildflowers, rocky outcroppings or boulders, the curve of the horizon</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling wind, birdsong, distant sounds carried far</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> fresh air, earthy soil, distant carcasses</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> touch of tall grass, rasp of scrub brush, crunch of dry dirt</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> cooling of gentle wind, heat of direct sunlight, massive black thunderclouds</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Swamp</h3><p>Wetlands are the most common kind of swamp, but this category also includes drier marshes such as moors.</p><p>• Bogs: Shallow bogs are difficult terrain for Medium creatures. Squares in deep bogs cost Medium creatures 10 extra feet of Speed per square, not just 5! If a bog is deep enough that a creature can’t reach the bottom, the creature has to use Athletics to Swim (DC 12).</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Heavy undergrowth gives standard cover to anyone in it, but it’s even harder to move through. Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement, not just 5!</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> lush leaves, clouds of gnats, algae-coated water, shacks on stilts, darting fish</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> croaking frogs, chirping insects, bubbling waters, splashing</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> rich moss and algae, pungent swamp gases</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> pushing through floating detritus, tangling creepers, thick mud</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> oppressive humidity, still air, pouring rain, rays of sunlight</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Underground</h3><p>Most underground environments consist of caves and other natural formations. Artificial dungeons and ruins combine underground features with urban features, like stairs and walls. Deep underground vaults have some of the same terrain features as mountains, such as chasms and cliffs.</p><p>• Cliffs and Slopes: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a cliff (DC 10 for sloped cliffs, 15 for steep cliffs, or 20 for sheer cliffs or steep ones with few handholds). Without safety precautions like a creature farther up securing a rope, a critical failure can result in significant falling damage (bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen).</p><p>• Floors: Natural cavern floors are rarely flat. They tend to have abrupt changes in elevation that are difficult terrain or require using Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} (DC 10 or 12).</p><p>• Ledges: Moving across a narrow ledge requires using Acrobatics to Balance (DC 12).</p><p>• Magma: Caverns deep underground might have magma flowing within. Just the heat from being near magma is harmful, causing 1d6 fire damage each round to anyone within 10 feet. Going into the magma is almost certain death for anyone not immune to fire. It deals 20d6 fire damage every round!</p><p>• Rubble: Difficult terrain. Especially deep or pervasive rubble requires Acrobatics to Balance on when crossing it as well (DC 17).</p><p>• Walls: Athletics to Climb a natural cave wall (DC 20). Since most caves are formed by water, cave walls are often damp, making the DC 22 or 25.</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> winding passages, sputtering yellow torchlight, uneven or cracked floors, ancient writings or architecture, stalagmites and stalactites</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> dripping condensation, scurrying rats or insects, distant clunks of machinery, tinny echoes of your voices and footsteps</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> staleness of still air, sulfur, tang of metal deposits</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> rough rock walls, stone smoothed by erosion, cobwebs</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> chill of underground air, geothermal heat</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Urban</h3><p>Urban environments include open city spaces as well as buildings. The building information in this section also applies to ruins and constructed dungeons.</p><p>• Crowds: Crowded thoroughfares and similar areas are difficult terrain. You might allow a creature to persuade a crowd to part and allow it to pass using Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance.</p><p>A crowd exposed to an obvious danger, like a fire or a rampaging monster, attempts to move away from the danger as quickly as possible, but a crowd is slowed by its own mass. A fleeing crowd typically moves at a Speed of 25 feet, potentially trampling or leaving behind slower-moving members of the crowd.</p><p>• Doors: Opening a door takes an Interact action. Locked doors require a creature to use Thievery to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H]{Pick a Lock}. The DC and number of successes required to open the lock depend on the quality of the lock. Remember that a critical success is worth two successes!</p><p>• Rooftops: Flat roofs are easy to move across. Angled roofs require creatures to use Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} (DC 13) or, if they’re especially steep, Athletics to Climb (DC 13).</p><p>Hurtling from roof to roof often requires using Athletics for a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump}, though some buildings are close enough to Leap between. A High Jump might be necessary to reach a higher roof.</p><p>• Sewers: Sewers are generally 10 feet or more below street level and are equipped with ladders or other means to ascend and descend. Raised paths along the walls allow sewer workers access, while channels in the center carry waste. Sewers grates require 2 or more Interact actions to open, though they might be locked using the rules for locked doors above.</p><p>• Stairs: Difficult terrain for creatures moving up them, normal for creatures moving down.</p><p>• Walls: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} (DC 18 for a constructed stone wall, DC 20 for a brick wall).</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> milling crowds, domesticated animals, multi-story buildings, trash blowing in the streets</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> town criers, shouting children, rattling wagon wheels</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> freshly baked bread, chimney smoke, industrial fumes, perfume, sewage</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> smooth cobblestones</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> rain on the rooftops</p><h3>In Otari</h3><p>These details are especially pronounced in @JournalEntry[NNmKsnjJOZogP2fO]{Otari}.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> docked boats laden with fish, lumber sliding down the road toward the dock</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> caught fish, freshly cut lumber</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> sawmill blades whirring</p></article></section>","markdown":""},"_id":"AJZOnRliAzq7nbDM","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.oiCmDc80T3El2rDj.JournalEntryPage.N97N5rz8ZcJ9jGCD"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Locations","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<figure class=\"head\"><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/blazing-desert.webp\" width=\"650\" title /></figure><p>Bring out the players’ curiosity through memorable settings that include mysterious and fantastical locations for the heroes to visit!

For every hour spent in temperatures from -21º to 12º, a creature takes [[/r 1d6 #cold]] cold damage.

This circumstance penalty is -1 for a weak wind or -2 for a stronger wind. Powerful windstorms can make physical ranged attacks impossible! Wind snuffs out handheld flames. Particularly strong winds might require a creature to succeed at a DC 15 Athletics check each time it attempts to move. On a failure, the creature doesn’t move on that action, and on a critical failure, it’s knocked back 5 feet and falls prone. Any moderate or strong wind is difficult terrain for a flying monster moving against the wind.</p></article></section>","markdown":""},"_id":"mhP6TyghfJ6AE3ia","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.RfiFMieaKMI9mGw2.JournalEntryPage.owZOOtdJXYKqTyKI"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"Drawing a Map","type":"text","_id":"DO1O6PCbKiDKZccR","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Many adventures focus on a single location or dungeon. Once you know your adventure's story, you can start drawing the map to make it easier to keep track of where everything is. It's best to draw the map on a sheet of graph paper first, with each square on the graph paper representing a 5-foot square. Then, when you run the game, you can use a map with a 1-inch grid (where every square inch represents a 5-foot square).</p><p>When you first draw your map, you should use a pencil so you can make changes easily. You can also jot down notes for each room as they come to you, like \"guard post\" or \"spider nest.\"</p><h3>Sample Map</h3><p>Here you can see the sketch used to make the first level of the \"Menace under Otari\" map! Below it is a set of symbols you can use to represent common features found in most dungeons: doors, stairs, traps, pillars, and more.</p><figure><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/gmg-sketch.webp\" width=\"650\" title /><figcaption><br /></figcaption><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/gmg-sketch-key.webp\" width=\"650\" title /></figure><h2>Mapping Tips</h2><p>• <strong>Avoid Empty Rooms</strong>: Don’t add too many empty rooms, as they can clutter your map and get boring and repetitive quickly.</p><p>• <strong>Leave Room for Expansion</strong>: Unless you’re certain you don’t want to return to your dungeon, allow for places to expand later for future adventures. A tunnel running off the edge of the map, a flight of stairs leading down, or a large pit can all lead the way to new areas.</p><p>• <strong>Avoid Symmetry</strong>: Refrain from creating symmetrical dungeons in which one half is an exact mirror image of the other— it's unrealistic, and the players might be disappointed when they realize that they only have to explore half of a dungeon to see it all.</p><p>• <strong>Vary Room Shapes</strong>: Instead of just a bunch of rectangles, include strangely shaped rooms, alcoves, multilevel rooms, irregular caverns, and other variations. You can look at maps of real-world locations to get some ideas.</p><p>• <strong>Use Wide Corridors</strong>: Remember that combat in Pathfinder is based on 5-foot squares. If you fill your dungeon with 5-foot-wide hallways, you might end up with combats in which some of the heroes or monsters can’t actually get into the fight!</p><p>• <strong>Don't Make a Maze</strong>: Avoid the temptation to make your map into a maze- exploring one gets old quick once you're playing, especially if you spend most of your time during the game drawing twisted corridors on your mat when you could be running combat!</p><h2>Finishing the Map</h2><p>Once you're happy with your map, inking in the pencil lines makes the map a lot easier to read. You can use a fat-tipped pen to draw solid walls. Thinner pens are great for drawing doors and map symbols. Adding color (whether with pens or colored pencils) makes your map even easier to read. Number each room so you can easily refer to it in your notes. If possible, use a pen of a different color from anything else on your map so the number tags are easy to see.</p><p>If you have a computer and scanner, you can scan your map and then use an image-editing program to refine it. This is handy if you make an error on the map with ink and need to fix things. Details such as furniture, fire pits, pillars, and so on add a touch of realism to inhabited dungeons, but you can also add these when you draw it on a battle grid if you feel comfortable doing so on the fly.</p><p>Once you've finished your map, you can upload it to your VTT of choice and add walls, lights, or tokens as you see fit. Even a hand-drawn map can work perfectly well in a digital environment- just be sure to supplement it with descriptions of the rooms to breathe some life into your creation! </p><h2>Strange Rooms</h2><p>If you’re having a hard time coming up with ideas for your map, you can take ideas from “Menace under Otari,” or use some of these classic ideas.</p><p>• Monster barracks full of filthy straw nests.</p><p>• Narrow ledge overlooking a chasm.</p><p>• Natural chimney in the rock that the heroes can climb up to reach a higher level.</p><p>• Ancient library covered in dust.</p><p>• Long hallway with rows of statues or suits of armor.</p><p>• Sewer chamber blocked by gates on each side, with the levers to open them in another room.</p><p>• Feasting hall with a large fire pit in the center.</p><p>• Pens where guard animals are kept.</p><p>• Museum with art made of permanent illusions.</p><p>• Don't forget the latrines!</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":50000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.xsFyTuQjIqtbqONX.JournalEntryPage.P1u6guBM6Tz1tAiK"}}},{"name":"Exploration","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<figure class=\"head\"><img class=\"noborder light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/desert-ruin.webp\" width=\"650\" /></figure><p>As heroes move from place to place, exploring a dungeon, wilderness, or city, the game is flexible. If a fight breaks out during exploration, the game turns into an @UUID[JournalEntry.OxJPjPEL0hZAvHw2.JournalEntryPage.ZFjG6Np42VRz5hFu]{Encounter?}, which follows a more specific set of rules.</p><p>Exploration involves movement and roleplaying, and the GM determines the flow of time based on what the heroes do. Your hero might be traveling from one town to another, chatting with a couple of merchants at an outpost along the way, or having a terse conversation with the watchful city guards at your destination. If the GM needs to track how long travel takes, they'll use this table- the party travels at the speed of its slowest member.</p><table class=\"av-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"av-table-header\"><th>Hero's Speed</th><th>Miles per Hour</th><th>Miles per Day</th></tr><tr class=\"av-table-row\"><td>20 feet</td><td>2</td><td>16</td></tr><tr class=\"av-table-row\"><td>25 feet</td><td>2.5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr class=\"av-table-row\"><td>30 feet</td><td>3</td><td>24</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Between encounters, the heroes often explore dungeons or other environments. Time is more flexible during exploration than in encounters and is measured in 10-minute intervals or more. You tell the players what happens, and you can skip over any parts of their travels that aren’t interesting!</p><h3>Set a Party Order</h3><p>When the group starts exploring, let the players decide among themselves where in the group their heroes are while exploring. This order can determine who gets attacked first when enemies or traps threaten from various directions. It’s up to you to determine the specifics of who gets targeted based on the situation.</p><p>When an encounter starts, the group usually remains in the same general formation. With the heroes' input, decide their positions when you put the tokens on the scene. If they get the drop on their enemies or detect a hazard in advance, they can move around as they see fit before dealing with it.</p><h2>Exploration Activities</h2><p>While the party explores, each player who wants to do something beyond just traveling chooses an exploration activity for their character. Players usually choose from the default activities, but there’s no need for them to memorize the exploration activities and use them exactly. Instead, when your players want to do something in addition to simply traveling, have them describe the basics of what they're attempting to do, such as “I’m searching for hazards” or “I’m keeping my shield ready in case we’re attacked.” As the GM, you find the best exploration activity to match their description and describe the effects of that activity. Some exploration activities limit how fast a character can travel and be effective.</p><p>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.IE2nThCmoyhQA0Jn]{Avoid Notice} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.cYtYKa1gDEl7y2N0]{Defend} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Yb0C1uLzeHrVLl7a]{Detect Magic} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JuqmIAnkL9hVGai8]{Hustle} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EwgTZBWsc8qKaViP]{Investigate} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.kV3XM0YJeS2KCSOb]{Scout} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Search} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.fJImDBQfqfjKJOhk]{Sense Direction}</p><p>If a player wants to do something not on the list of exploration activities above, you can let them if they could reasonably do it while walking around. If the activity is similar to an action someone could use in an encounter, it usually consists of a single action repeated roughly 10 times per minute. You might find that a player wants to do something equivalent to spending 3 actions every 6 seconds (18 times per minute), just like they would in combat. However, heroes can’t maintain that level of exertion in exploration mode without getting exhausted. They can do so in combat only because combat lasts such a short time.</p><h3>Narrating Exploration</h3><p>As the group explores, describe the sights, sounds, and sensations. Encourage the other players to have their heroes truly explore, and reward their curiosity. The things they try to do in exploration mode show you what they’re interested in and what they consider important. As you play, you should get a good feel for what intrigues certain players, and you can add more of those things to your adventures or emphasize these points in published adventures.</p><p>Activities like Detect Magic, Investigate, and Search can tip off a player that something is odd about an area. But that doesn't mean they know exactly what it is! Instead, use these as a starting point for a roleplaying scene. For instance, if a character finds something magical with detect magic, the party likely still needs to stop and look at the surroundings in more detail to figure out what it is.</p><p>Similarly, if a character got a 22 on their Perception check to Search while traveling through an area containing a trap that needs a DC 20 to detect it, you should tell the player that their character noticed a trap in the area, and you can give a rough idea of the trap’s location and nature. The party needs to stop and examine the area more to learn specifics about the trap</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"zvGaSL2IpbvcyeUQ","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":-100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.H4hH0Kuwqz9NmgrD.JournalEntryPage.Vl9bA0NMLbjLH9om"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"system":{}}],"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r":3},"flags":{"pf2e-beginner-box":{"isBB":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.0-alpha1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1661876621624,"modifiedTime":1662412802590,"lastModifiedBy":"ZJ6r3OyrumO4W34r"},"_id":"xsFyTuQjIqtbqONX"},{"pages":[{"name":"Hungry Rats","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The first encounter happens in the basement of the Otari Fishery.

Whenever a character is subjected to poison, they must attempt a special check called a saving throw to resist its effects. There are three types of saving throw: a Fortitude save is typically for resisting poison or disease, a Reflex save is for dodging away from falling debris or avoiding a deadly beam from a spell, and a Will save is usually for resisting spells and magic that befuddle the mind.</p><p>Anyone who is bitten by the spider must immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw by clicking the d20 icon under \"Fortitude\" in the saves section of their character sheet. If the result is equal to or greater than 16, they resist the poison and suffer no ill effect. If the result is less than 16, the poison takes hold! The details of the poison's effects are included in its stat block.</p><h3>Ranged Strikes</h3><p>The giant spider also has a special ranged Strike that lets it throw webbing to trap a nearby creature. Unlike for a melee Strike, the giant spider doesn’t have to be adjacent to a hero to target them with a ranged Strike—it can target a hero anywhere in the room. Otherwise, a ranged Strike works just like a melee Strike. Choose a target by hovering over the token and pressing T, then click the \"Strike+ 7\" button on the giant spider’s Web Strike, and then compare the total to the Armor Class of the target hero to see if it hits.</p><p>While ranged Strikes normally deal damage just like melee Strikes, this web Strike is special. If the attack roll is a success, the target doesn’t take any damage. Instead, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} and can’t move out of their square until they successfully use the Escape basic action. You can apply the Immobilized effect by dragging it from this journal directly to the affected token. The target can attempt a check to Escape using the Acrobatics skill or Athletics skill, or a fists attack roll, and the DC is 17. Each attempt to Escape is a single action.</p><p>If the total result of the check to Escape is 17 or greater, the target breaks free from the webs and can move freely. You can remove the immobilization effect by right-clicking on the affected token, clicking the \"Assign Status Effects\" button on the right, and then right-clicking the immobilized effect.  A stuck hero can still attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally, but they can’t move from their current space on the map.</p></article></section><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>Sometimes challenges offer multiple ways for the heroes to overcome them.

If the heroes solve the puzzle, they can gain extra treasure and make their explorations safer! Read the following aloud when the heroes enter this room.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">The door to this chamber silently glides open to reveal a long room. Two stone statues of priests stand in the corners along one side of the room, facing a towering statue of a man holding out both of his hands, palms up. In front of this statue is a stone altar holding nine golden coins. A voice booms out from the statue.<br /><em>\"In my hands I judge the value of all wealth, raising up whichever is greater. One of these coins is a deception.

On a success, they know the statue depicts Abadar, the god of wealth and civilization.</p><h2>The Puzzle</h2><p>The statue and the coins represent a puzzle. The challenge here is to identify which of the coins is fake. All of them look identical and they all weigh exactly the same, but the fake coin is worth less than the others. Explain to the players that when the heroes place coins in the statue’s hands, it will raise the hand that has a higher value. So if the heroes put four coins in each hand and the right hand contains the fake, the statue will raise the left hand. After two attempts, the statue asks the heroes to identify the fake.</p><p>If they fail to identify the fake coin, all the coins vanish and reappear in a random order atop the altar. If the coins are taken from the altar and not placed in the hands, they also vanish and the puzzle resets. Any real coins added to the puzzle vanish immediately, added to the vault in @UUID[.gz9x5HmzjSvvBLQp]{Area 10}. The heroes can try again as many times as they’d like. Failing to solve this puzzle doesn’t prevent the heroes from completing the adventure, but it does make the next combat a bit more challenging because of the trap in @UUID[.KWTky7M63NvVIVRz]{Area 11}.</p><p>If they succeed, the real coins fall to the floor and the heroes can take them as treasure (each is worth 1 gp), while the fake coin turns to lead. In addition, the door to Area 10 slowly swings open (you can reveal this area by clicking on the secret door to open it), which gives the heroes access to Abadar’s treasure and allows them to adjust the traps in Area 11 to work in their favor.</p><p>When running this puzzle for the players, tell the players they must decide how they want to weigh coins numbered 1 through 9, and secretly pick which number represents the fake coin. If they fail to identify the fake coin and decide to try again, pick a new number (since the puzzle resets). The players might accidentally pick the fake coin without solving the puzzle, and that’s okay—adventurers get lucky sometimes! To make this puzzle simpler, you might want to provide props, like pieces of paper with a coin drawn on each one, numbered 1 through 9.</p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>The trick to solving the puzzle is to split the coins into three groups of three coins each. By placing one group of three in each hand and leaving the third group on the altar, the players can determine which group contains the fake coin. If one hand rises, the other hand contains the fake. If neither rises, then the fake is in the three coins that were left on the altar. The heroes then need to repeat this process with the group containing the fake, by placing one coin in each hand and leaving the third on the altar. If one hand rises, the coin in the other hand is the fake. If neither rises, the coin on the altar is the fake.</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>Not all challenges are dangerous!

This trap is active only if the heroes set the lever in @UUID[.gz9x5HmzjSvvBLQp]{Area 10} to “active.” Otherwise, it has no effect.</p><p>This trap affects part of the floor in this chamber. If the trap is active, the first creature to step on a floor tile in the white-outlined area triggers the trap—and it’s most likely the kobolds, who don’t realize the heroes have activated the trap! The trap shoots spears from the western wall, making a ranged Strike against the first creature in each row. Unlike the earlier trap, this trap has a Reset entry—if it’s not disabled, it resets after 1 minute and fires again the next time a creature moves in the outlined area.</p><h3>Kobold Snares</h3><p>The kobold trapmaster also has traps of her own- snares which she can set up as mobile traps. She sets them on the three squares located at the top of the stairs just to the east of the outlined area. You can use the @Actor[X1ZVzivrcAqbNDq2]{Spike Trap} actor to mark where they were placed. Once set up, these snares can be disarmed, but they can’t be reused—once they go off, they’re no longer a threat.</p><h3>Kobold Tactics</h3><p>Two kobold warriors are stationed here, along with a kobold trapmaster. All three kobolds have orders to make sure that no one reaches the kobold lair below.</p><p>The kobolds hear the door creak as it opens, so as soon as the heroes enter the room, the kobolds are ready to fight. Roll initiative (using Perception) for the kobold warriors and the trapmaster separately.</p><p>The two warriors start the combat at either side of the spiral staircase leading down, but they move to block the stairs at the start of their first turn. If the heroes activated the central spears trap using the control mechanism in Area 10, the kobolds set off that trap the moment they move into the outlined area to block the stairs. See Central Spears above for more information.</p><p>The kobold trapmaster stays where she is, spending all of her actions to lay down small spike traps. If she puts down all three of her spike traps, she then uses her spears to attack the heroes from afar until they approach.</p></article></section><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>For overcoming the kobolds and the hazards in this room, give each hero 136 XP.</p><h2>Strange Jewelry</h2><p>After defeating the kobolds, the players can examine their fallen foes. The kobolds’ gear is listed in their stat blocks.</p><p>The kobold trapmaster is wearing a special necklace: a simple copper chain and a cracked piece of a large eggshell. The shell is ivory in color, but it has strange green veins running through it. This piece is only about 3 inches across, but the egg it came from must have been at least 2 feet wide. Even if the heroes take this piece back to town, no one can identify what sort of creature would lay such a massive egg, although Tamily speculates that it might have come from a giant turtle or another reptile. The heroes have the chance to learn more about this strange egg later in the dungeon.</p><h2>Going Down?</h2><p>After defeating the kobolds, the heroes can take their belongings (noted in each creature’s stat block). The heroes won’t find other treasure in the room, but there’s another exit: the spiral staircase in the back of the room descends even deeper into the earth.</p><p>This is a great time for the heroes to rest and regain their spells and Hit Points before pressing onward. You should remind them of this option and encourage them to head back up to Otari to report what they discovered. They can also use this time to sell any treasure they’ve found and purchase additional gear.</p><p>If the heroes report to Tamily Tanderveil about the scaly creatures creeping around the caverns, she’s shaken by the story of what they found underneath her fishery, and she implores the heroes to press on to put an end to this menace. She can identify the creatures as kobolds, small reptilian humanoids related to dragons who live in small tribes and have a fondness for traps. She also notes the amount of fish that has gone missing is far greater than what could have been eaten by a handful of kobolds. Tamily is worried that there’s something far hungrier beneath the city, and she shares her concern with the heroes.</p><p>If the players have had a particularly hard time with the adventure thus far, you can also use this opportunity to give them a bit of help. Tamily has a pair of @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.2RuepCemJhrpKKao]{Potions of Healing} stored away in case of emergency. A hero who drinks one of these potions immediately regains 1d8 Hit Points. Tamily gladly gives both potions to the heroes if they agree to continue their exploration.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"150\" /><h2>Changing Scenes</h2><p> </p></header><article><p>When your players are ready to proceed downstairs, you'll need to move their tokens down.

This gives it the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition, making it hard to hit with attacks. Whenever a hero attempts a spell attack roll or Strikes the rat, first ask the player to roll a flat check—a d20 roll with nothing added. If the die comes up with a 5 or higher, the hero can attack normally. If the roll is a 4 or less, the attack misses.</p><p>The smoke also chokes nearby creatures, forcing them to make fortitude saves to avoid choking.</p><h3>Persistent Damage</h3><p>Whenever the cinder rat hits a hero, that hero catches on fire! This deals persistent damage, a special type of damage that doesn’t happen right away. Instead, that hero takes [[/r 1d4 #persistent fire]]{1d4 persistent fire damage} at the end of their turn (not the rat’s turn). The hero can then attempt a flat check (roll a d20 without adding anything) to see if the fire goes out—if the result is a 15 or higher, the flames are extinguished! If not, they’ll take the damage again at the end of their next turn (rolling 1d4 each time they take this damage), and then roll a new flat check. This happens at the end of every turn until the fire goes out.</p><p>There are other actions a hero can use to put out the fire. A hero can spend an action to pat out the flames. If they do, they can roll a flat check right away, before they take the damage, as described above. A hero might also think to go jump in the puddle of water. If they drop to the ground in a square filled with water (gaining the prone condition), the flames go out automatically.</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>If the heroes encounter and defeat the cinder rat, award each hero 80 XP.</p></article></section><h2>Elemental Aid</h2><p>After the fight with the rat, the heroes can investigate the other two orbs. Both are intact and appear to be relatively stable. If anyone casts detect magic in this chamber, they sense the presence of magic.</p><p>The air orb is filled with a swirling cloud. If anyone touches it, a rush of wind fills the room, carrying a voice like a whisper. It says, “Call upon the wind to gain my blessing and soar through the sky.” This gives the heroes a special ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. By spending 1 action to call upon the wind, that hero can fly for their next action, moving up to 40 feet. They have to end the movement on solid ground—if they don’t, they fall and take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance they fell.</p><p>If the heroes touch the earth orb, they hear grinding and grumbling, like boulders falling down a hill. In this cacophony, they hear another voice that says, \"Call upon the earth to gain its strength.\" The heroes gain a second ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. If a hero spends an action to call upon the earth, all their melee Strikes deal 2 extra damage from a sudden surge of strength. This bonus lasts until the start of the hero's next turn.</p><p>The orb's magical effects happen only once.

Since this is their home, they have a few other tricks they can use against the heroes. Use these throughout the fight to add variety and keep the players on their toes!</p><ul><li><strong>Bed Cover</strong>: A kobold in one of the sleeping chambers can spend 1 action to pull a sleeping mat off the floor and hide behind it. Doing so grants the kobold @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.other-effects.I9lfZUiCwMiGogVi]{Effect: Cover} until they move or the start of their next turn.</li><li><strong>Food Fight</strong>: A kobold adjacent to the table can spend 1 action to pick up a scrap of rotting meat and throw it at a hero within 20 feet. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 to hit. If the Strike hits, it doesn’t deal damage. Instead, the hero is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} until they spend an action to clean the gross food off (no check needed).</li><li><p><strong>Oil Attack</strong>: The chest between two of the sleeping alcoves contains, among other things, three jars of slippery oil. A kobold must spend an action to open the chest before they can use the oil stored inside. Once the chest is open, a kobold next to it can spend 1 action to pick up and throw one of these jars of oil. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 to hit. If it hits a hero, that hero and the square they’re in are coated in slippery oil. On a miss, the oil covers the ground but not the hero. The kobold can also throw the oil at an empty square to make just the square slippery.<br />For the rest of the fight, a hero covered in oil has trouble moving. Each time they Stride, they must attempt a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:10]{Acrobatics Skill Check}. If they fail, they fall over and gain the prone condition instead of moving. The hero can Step, moving only 5 feet, without this check.<br />Anyone who moves through a square covered in oil must attempt a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:10]{Acrobatics Skill Check}. If they fail, they stop moving and fall.</p></li></ul></article></section><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>For overcoming the kobolds in this room, award each hero 120 XP. Note that the heroes can earn additional XP depending on how they handle the last remaining kobold.</p><h2>Kobold Surrender</h2><p>When only one kobold remains, he immediately drops his weapons and surrenders to the heroes, begging and groveling for his life with a raspy, high-pitched voice. If the heroes spare the kobold, the creature promises to leave and never return, but he also quietly adds that he's willing to share secrets in exchange for gold.</p><p>The heroes have two options if they want to learn what the kobold knows. The first is to offer the kobold the gold he requests. If they give the kobold 10 gp, he shares what he knows about the boss, and if they give him 20 gp (total, not in addition), he also shares what he knows about the dragon.</p><p>But parting with their hard-earned wealth isn't the only solution. A hero can try to persuade the kobold to share what he knows by rolling a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:10]{Diplomacy} skill check, or they can bully the kobold with an @Check[type:intimidation|dc:10]{Intimidation} skill check. If a hero's total is 10 or more, they learn about the boss, and if their total is 20 or more, they learn about the dragon, too.</p><p><strong>About the Boss</strong>: The kobold says the following about their warren's boss.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">\"Boss Zolgran is the big leader of the mighty kobolds, and she has powerful magics to roast you alive! She's very angry all the time and demands much from her servants. Especially now that we have a powerful new friend!\"</p><p><strong>About the Dragon</strong>: The kobold says the following about the dragon.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">\"The friend is a dragon and a blessing from the gods, a sign that kobolds are destined to return to the surface and conquer the pathetic human town. As soon as the hatchling is all grown, we'll rise up to take what is ours!\"</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>If the heroes get the surrendered kobold to tell them about the boss, award each hero an additional 10 XP. If they get him to tell them about the dragon, increase this bonus to 30 XP instead.</p><section class=\"box-text treasure\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/icon-treasure.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Treasure</h2><p>@Actor[1S486XWdfcEWYv6T]{Kobold Loot}</p></header><article><p>Once the fight ends, the heroes can examine the rest of the warren.

If the heroes slay these guards but still retreat, Zolgran recruits two @Actor[r9w1n85mp9Ip4QiS]{Kobold Warriors} to serve as her new guards for the next time the heroes arrive. They aren't as powerful as kobold scouts, but they still help defend their boss.</p></article></section><p> </p><p>The kobolds' boss lives in this chamber, accompanied by two kobold scouts. Place the boss on the throne, and put the two scouts at the bottom of the stairs. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">A gaping pit opens in the floor in the center of this large, natural chamber. On the far side, a ledge overlooks the entry. Atop this ledge is an ornate stone throne that looks entirely out of place for this room. A regal kobold wearing an oversized crown made of fish bones sits atop the throne. “Kill the intruders!” she snarls at the two kobold guards at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>Things have been rough for the band over the past few years, but their fortune changed when they got the chance to steal a dragon’s egg! With the precious treasure spirited away to the kobold hideout, the boss, Zolgran, has devised grand plans for her band now that it has a dragon patron. After raising the dragon, she hopes to use the beast to subjugate the entire region and finally reclaim the town of Otari for her people. Fortunately for the citizens of Otari, the baby dragon isn't fully grown yet—but the new hatchling is always hungry. That's why the band moved into these caverns, and why they've been raiding the Otari Fishery. Without a steady supply of food, the young dragon might turn to having kobolds for a snack!</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/icon-monster.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Encounter</h2><p>@Actor[AleeS0IRqT4tUphB]{Zolgran, the Kobold Boss}, @Actor[rPaHIh0ICnTLnRO6]{2 Kobold Scouts}</p></header><article><h3>The Pit</h3><p>This pit in the center of this chamber is 20 feet deep. Heroes attempting to leap across the pit must spend 2 actions and attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|showDC:all]{Athletics skill check}. If they fail, they fall down into the pit, taking 10 damage. A hero in the pit has to climb out, which requires them to succeed at two @Check[type:athletics|dc:10|showDC:all]{Athletics skill check} in a row.</p><h3>Kobold Tactics</h3><p>The dragon isn't yet tame enough to do the boss's bidding, so the kobolds have kept the creature in a nearby cave (@UUID[.KMTBj18whqvjGZBz]{Area 19}), safely tucked away from rest of the band. Unfortunately for the heroes, the boss and her guards are more than dangerous enough on their own.</p><p>The two kobold scouts move to either side of the pit to block the heroes from getting to their boss, but they chase any hero who manages to get past them. Meanwhile, Zolgran assaults the groups using spells! The crafty kobold can cast spells just like a wizard. The spells she has prepared are listed in her stat block.</p><p>On her first turn, she spends all 3 actions to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]{Magic Missile}. This spell fires three missiles, which she aims at the closest three heroes to deal 1d4+1 force damage each. If anyone gets past her guards, she casts @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4koZzrnMXhhosn0D]{Fear} on that hero, hoping to make them run away. If she runs out of 1st-level spells to cast, she casts @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gYjPm7YwGtEa1oxh]{Ray of Frost}. Zolgran attacks with her staff only if she runs out of other options.</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>If the heroes defeat Zolgran and her guards, award each hero 100 XP.

Heroes who examine the out-of-place throne can match its design to the decor of @UUID[.KWTky7M63NvVIVRz]{Area 11} on the floor above, which is where the kobolds took it from. Most importantly, there's an old, rusty iron chest. Atop this chest is a large, broken eggshell that's almost 2 feet tall. Ivory in color, the shell has green veins running through it, and it’s clear that the pieces of eggshell worn by the boss and many of the kobolds here came from this egg. Although it’s still not entirely clear what was inside, there are large claw marks, bigger than any kobold could make, down one side of the shell.</p><figure class=\"left\"><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-items/smoking-sword.webp\" height=\"280\" /></figure><h3>Inside the Chest</h3><p>The chest is locked, but Zolgran has the key tied at her waist.

If the players manage to open the chest, reveal the loot actor to them on the map.</p><p>Inside the chest are some of the more interesting treasure that the kobolds found during their exploration of these tunnels. The treasure includes a silver bracelet with a fish pattern worth 5 gp, a very old map that depicts some strange-looking dungeon, a <em>smoking sword</em> with a dwarven face carved into the hilt, a wand of <em>heal</em>, 2 <em>healing potions</em>, and a <em>hat of disguise</em>.</p></article></section><h2>Are we Done?</h2><p>If the PCs defeat the kobolds and their boss, they might return to the Otari Fishery. If they decide not to explore any further, the adventure can easily end here. Tamily happily pays the heroes for completing the job, even if she does wonder what was in that mighty egg. She's also curious as to what happened to all the fish, as the kobolds couldn’t possibly have eaten it all, but such mysteries will have to wait for another day.</p><aside class=\"bb-float-block\"><h3>Audio Cue</h3><p>If your players decide to press on, you can use the Dragon Soundboard effects \"Wyrmling Growl Distant\" to warn them of the imminent danger of continuing before they have prepared. </p></aside><p>In this case—or if the heroes don’t end up fleeing from the next encounter—the young dragon in the kobolds' care survives!
