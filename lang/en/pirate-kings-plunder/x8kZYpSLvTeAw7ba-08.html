<p class="box-text narrative">With a swish, your blade slices right through the snake and it falls dead at your feet with a loud thud. Stepping around its body, you check the room for anything of value. You find a very old, tarnished silver coin wedged between two stones on the floor. It must have been here for ages, but it will buy you a night at the inn back in town when this is all over.</p>
<p>Add 1 silver to your scratch paper.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Leaving the dead serpent behind, you head toward the passageway opposite the entrance. Unlike the caves that came before, this tunnel looks like it was carefully dug out of the earth and meticulously reinforced with wood and stone. After about 20 feet, the passageway forks, heading off to the right and the left. You can hear the faint sound of splashing water to the right, while a very cold breeze drifts out of the passage to the left. Which way do you go?</p>
