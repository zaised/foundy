<p class="box-text narrative">Your vision grows dark as life leaves your body. In your final moments, you canâ€™t help but think that this is not how stories should end. Maybe the next hero will fare better in this deadly place...</p>
<p>Although you have died, there are still adventures to be had. You can start this adventure over by returning to Entry @JournalEntry[84g4A22otQbtAqYu]{#01}. You are restored to full Hit Points, but so are all of the foes that you have faced. You must explore and face whatever dangers await you all over again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can start making your own character to play in adventures with others. Go to @JournalEntry[KIpNnMtah73eyPC8]{Creating Your Hero} to begin designing your very own hero!</p>
