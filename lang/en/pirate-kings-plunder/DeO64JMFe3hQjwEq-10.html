<p class="box-text narrative">The passageway winds through ancient rock, but it's clear that someone has made it wider with a pickaxe, although it looks like the work was done many years ago. After squeezing hurriedly through a narrow crevice with a ceiling supported only by a rotting log, you find yourself in a small chamber. Roots grow down from above, breaking through the ceiling and letting in faint, dappling light here and there across the cavern. Opposite the entrance is another corridor, but before you can head down that way, you hear a terrible hissing sound coming from the passageway. Emerging from the darkness is a gigantic snake with terrifying fangs!</p>
<p>You are now in combat with a snake! Just as when fighting the wolf, you and the snake will take turns attacking one another until one side is defeated, but there are a few new things to pay attention to in this combat. In this fight, the snake gets to go first, but during its first turn, it must spend 2 of its 3 actions to close the distance before it can attack. So, on the snake’s first turn, it gets to spend only 1 action to attack you. On the rest of its turns it spends all 3 actions attacking.</p>

<p>On your turn, you can attack, just like in the previous fight. Unfortunately, there’s nothing to hide behind in this chamber, so you can’t boost your Armor Class like you could in the wolf fight. Also, if you took any damage in the last fight, remember that your HP still hasn't recovered!</p>

<h3>Dealing with Poison</h3>
<p>Whenever the snake bites you, it might poison you. This happens as part of the bite, so it doesn't use an action. When you are hit by the snake's bite, you must attempt a Saving Throw to resist the effects of the venom. Saving throws are special rolls to resist things that try to harm or control your character. There are three kinds of saving throws: Reflex saving throws are used to dodge a bolt of lightning or a fearsome dragon's fire breath; Will saving throws are used to resist spells that try to take over your mind; and Fortitude saving throws are used to fight off poisons and diseases.</p>
<p>You must attempt a Fortitude saving throw every time the snake bites you. Roll [[/r 1d20+8 #fortitude]]. If the result is equal to or greater than 16 (the DC of the poison), you fight it off and nothing happens. If the result is 15 or lower, you take an additional [[/r 1d8]] damage from the poison.</p>
