<p class="box-text narrative">The only way to get across the river is to swim through the dangerous water.</p>
<p>Swimming to the other side of the room requires a Skill Check. To attempt a skill check, roll a d20 and add the bonus associated with the skill you are trying to use. If the result is equal to or greater than the DC of the task, you succeed. In this case, you can use the Athletics skill to swim across. To make it to the other side, you must succeed at two Athletics checks, which each have a DC of 15.</p>
<p>Athletics Skill Check: [[/r 1d20+7]]</p>
<p>These checks can be dangerous. If you are in the water and fail too many Athletics checks to swim, you get swept downstream. Since the river leads deep underground, through long tunnels without air, youâ€™ll drown if you fail a total of three Athletics skill checks before you succeed at two checks and get out of the water.</p>
<p>If you fail three Athletics checks, you are dragged into the underground river and beaten against the rocks. Go to Entry @JournalEntry[0KrnycmJ3gpMxZCb]{#17}.</p>
<p>If you make it to the other side, you can make your way down the stairs; go to Entry @JournalEntry[5E8aGKifyMVJGp7l]{#03}.</p>
<p>If you instead decide to head back the way you came and try the other passage, go to Entry @JournalEntry[4Q8GPG7aA2857aQv]{#15}.</p>
