<p class="box-text narrative">Putting aside your fear, you squeeze your way through the crack into the narrow passageway beyond, lit only by faint light from above. If the cobwebs and dust are any indication, no one has been down this way for a long time. Up ahead, the passageway widens to form a cave chamber before veering to the left. <br /><br />A curtain of moss grows on the right wall of the small cavern, fed by a trickle of water dripping from the cavern ceiling. Something about it looks odd, but you canâ€™t quite figure it out without succeeding at a Perception check.</p>
<p>Your Perception indicates how good you are at noticing things. Your perception skill checks is [[/r 1d20+4 #Perception]]. Once you have rolled, compare the total to the Difficulty Class (DC), which is 15. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC, you succeed!</p>
<p>If you succeed at the Perception check, go to Entry @JournalEntry[N3o377DlgFJoplmb]{#24}.</p>
<p>If you fail the Perception check, go to Entry @JournalEntry[zBVNHcEICx4xYrvI]{#21}.</p>
