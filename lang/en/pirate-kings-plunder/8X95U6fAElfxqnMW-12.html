<p class="box-text narrative">After brushing aside some of the moss, you find small notches cut into the wall, making it simple to climb up into the crack. Someone must have carved these on purpose!<br /><br />Squeezing into the crevice, you find a small, cramped alcove behind it. It’s filled with moss, but you note two things: in the back of the room is an old leather pouch that is split open on one side, spilling a handful of coins across the floor. In addition, set into the floor in the center of the alcove is a stone lever.</p>
<p>If you gather up the coins, write on your scratch paper that you have 21 copper and 4 silver.</p>
<p>If you decide to pull the lever, go to Entry @JournalEntry[VKuqgiIv6ZOF37jY]{#14}.</p>
<p>If you ignore the lever, you crawl back out of the alcove and head down the passageway below. Go to Entry @JournalEntry[DeO64JMFe3hQjwEq]{#10}.</p>
