<p class="box-text narrative">You flee for your life, bolting past the statue to a crevice in the back wall. Squeezing through, you soon find a passage that leads back to the surface. You can go back to town and claim your reward, but you might still want to go back and claim the pirate statue’s plunder. Maybe with more experience and a bit of luck you’ll find a way to defeat it! But until then, you are looking forward to a warm meal and a comfortable bed.</p>
<p>Although you didn't get all of the treasure, you still did quite well in this solo adventure, making it all the way to the end.</p>
