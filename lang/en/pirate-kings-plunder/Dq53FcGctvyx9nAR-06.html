<p class="box-text narrative">The pirate statue falls to the floor in a thunderous crash, breaking into several pieces. With this last guardian defeated, you are free to gather up the loot and make your way back to town. In total, the pile of coins contains 79 copper, 25 silver, and 4 gold. But the real treasure was in the three gems you found. Two are simple agate gemstones worth 5 gold each, but the last is a sparkling ruby. It can easily sell for 20 gold, making this a very rewarding trip indeed!<br /><br />Gathering up the last of your loot, you prepare to head back to Otari and claim the reward for killing the wolf. While you are at it, you might just spring for the nicest room at the inn and maybe talk to the town blacksmith about getting a new suit of armor. But that is a tale for another adventure...</p>
<p>Congratulations on defeating this solo adventure! Did you collect all of the treasure? There is a total of 40 gold worth of coins and treasure you can find during this event, plus the reward. Remember that 10 copper is equal to 1 silver, and 10 silver is equal to 1 gold.</p>
