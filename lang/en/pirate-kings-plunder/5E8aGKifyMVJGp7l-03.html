<p class="box-text narrative">You travel down quite a distance before arriving in a large, cavernous chamber. A hole in the ceiling above allows in a thin shaft of light that illuminates a pile of coins and at least a couple glittering jewels. Standing in the center of this pile is a wooden statue, crudely carved to look like a pirate. The statue holds a wooden saber pointed menacingly in your direction.<br /><br />Drawing closer, you can tell that the statue has joints and hinges on its arms and legs, but by the time you realize it, you have drawn too close, and the statue comes to life! Swinging its saber back and forth, the menacing statue approaches you. As it draws near, you spot a strange-looking keyhole located in the middle of the statue’s neck.</p>
