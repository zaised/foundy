<p class="box-text narrative">Abandoning caution, you dive down the chute, heading into the freezing darkness!<br /><br />The surface is slick and freezing cold, and you pick up quite a bit of speed as you descend deeper into the earth. Just as the chute begins to level out, you see a massive icicle up ahead, blocking most of the tunnel. At this speed, running into it is going to hurt!</p>
<p>You can try to avoid hitting the icicle and taking any serious harm by attempting a DC 17 Reflex saving throw. Roll [[/r 1d20+5]].</p>
<p>If your check result is less than the DC, you take [[/r 1d8 #damage]] points of damage from running into the icicle. If you succeed, you take half damage (roll the d8 and divide the number rolled in half, rounding down). If your roll results in a 20, you critically succeed and avoid the icicle completely, taking no damage! Finally, if your roll results in a 1 or a 2, you critically fail the saving throw and take double damage (roll the d8 and double the result).</p>
<p>If you survive, the chute drops you into a large chamber. Go to Entry @JournalEntry[5E8aGKifyMVJGp7l]{#03}.</p>
<p>If hitting the icicle reduces you to 0 Hit Points or fewer, go to Entry @JournalEntry[0KrnycmJ3gpMxZCb]{#17}.</p>
