<p class="box-text narrative">It can’t be a coincidence that you found a key in the chamber above. Maybe it will help you defeat the statue, but you’re going to have to slow it down first.</p>
<p>You are now in combat with the pirate statue. To start this combat, you and the statue must start by rolling Initiative to determine who gets to act first. This is a Perception check that both of you attempt. The one who gets a higher result acts first in the combat (if you tie, the Statue goes first).</p>
<p>Your Perception bonus is [[/r 1d20+4 #perception]].</p>
<p>The pirate statue’s Perception bonus is [[/r 1d20+0 #perception]].</p>
<p>Roll for both of you to determine who goes first. If you go first, you must spend 1 action to move next to the statue before making any attacks. The statue is much slower, so if it goes first, it must spend 2 actions to move up to you before attacking.</p>
