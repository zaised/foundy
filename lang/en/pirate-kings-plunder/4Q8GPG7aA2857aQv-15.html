<p class="box-text narrative">You turn left and make your way down a narrow tunnel that leads into darkness. The air grows colder with each step you take and soon you can see your breath steaming in the gloom. Up ahead, the passage turns to the right, but a pale-blue radiance can be seen from around the corner. Just beyond the bend, the corridor opens into a small, icy chamber.<br /><br />Opposite you is an ice-covered chute that descends into darkness. Rimmed with icicles, it looks almost like a hungry maw. Above this chute, carved into the stone itself, is a warning. It reads, “An icy plunge may take you to the Pirate King’s treasure—or to your grave!”<br /><br />Hanging from the ceiling is a large icicle, and you can clearly see something glittering inside.</p>
