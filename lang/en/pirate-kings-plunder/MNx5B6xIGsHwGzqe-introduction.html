<p>In Pirate King's Plunder, you won't advance through the story by reading the journals in chronological order. Instead, at the end of each entry, you'll be presented with a set of choices. The decisions you make will lead you to different entries, which you can follow simply by clicking on the inline link.</p>
<p>Use the blank @JournalEntry[OJ6KXlPgacdLfZnC]{Scratch Paper} handout to help you keep track of actions you perform and items you pick up along the way. If you find yourself in combat, the @JournalEntry[Ogyn03yr9xH6oVNz]{Combat} handout has a summary of the relevant rules.</p>
<p>When you're ready, advance to Entry @JournalEntry[84g4A22otQbtAqYu]{#01} !</p>
