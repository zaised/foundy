<p class="box-text narrative">Now that the statue is slowed down, you can try to insert the key to see if it might help defeat this menace.</p>
<p>Inserting the key requires you to attempt an DC 20 Athletics Skill Check to grapple the statue. Roll [[/r 1d20+7 #Athletics]]. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC to grapple the statue, it falls to the ground, deactivated.</p>
<p>If you succeed, you defeat the statue! Go to Entry @JournalEntry[Dq53FcGctvyx9nAR]{#06}.</p>
<p>If you fail, continue the fight. Return to Entry @JournalEntry[IRGpMM5yy3BsheII]{#19}.</p>
