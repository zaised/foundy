<p class="box-text narrative">The burbling sound, echoing from somewhere up ahead, grows louder with every step until you can hear the sound of rushing water clearly. As you turn a corner, the source of the sound becomes apparent. The chamber up ahead is split in half by a stream that flows through the center of the room.<br /><br />This swift underground river enters the room from the right and flows out to the left. Across the way, you see a passageway that continues onward, and you can just make out a staircase going down. Discarded on the ground in front of you is an old torch, probably left here by a previous explorer.</p>
<p>If you take the torch, write “Torch” on your piece of scratch paper.</p>
