<p class="box-text narrative">In the center of the river is a pillar of stone that looks like it’s been submerged for a long time. You might be able to use it as a stepping-stone to jump across the river. However, you could also try to swim across.</p>
<p>Getting to the other side of the river requires a Skill Check. To attempt a skill check, roll a d20 and add the bonus associated with the skill you’re trying to use. If the result is equal to or greater than the DC of the task, you succeed! In this case, you can use Athletics to either jump across or swim across.</p>
<p>Your Athletics skill check: [[/r 1d20+7 #Athletics]]</p>

<h3>Jump (DC 10)</h3>
<p>If you try to jump across, you must succeed at two DC10 Athletics skill checks in a row (one to jump to the pillar and another to jump to the other side). If you fail either check, you fall in and must swim the rest of the way to the other side.</p>

<h3>Swim (DC 15)</h3>
<p>If you try to swim across, you must succeed at two DC15 Athletics skill checks. But if you succeeded at the check to jump to the pillar before falling in the water, you only need to succeed at one Athletics check to swim across, since you were already halfway.</p>

<p>These checks could be dangerous. If you're in the water and fail too many Athletics checks to swim, you get swept downstream. Since the river leads deep underground, through long tunnels without air, you'll drown if you fail a total of three Athletics skill checks before you succeed and get out of the water.</p>
<p>If you fail three Athletics checks, you are dragged into the underground river and beat against the rocks. Go to Entry @JournalEntry[0KrnycmJ3gpMxZCb]{#17}.</p>
<p>If you make it to the other side, you can make your way down the stairs. Go to Entry @JournalEntry[5E8aGKifyMVJGp7l]{#03}.</p>
<p>If you instead decide to head back the way you came and try the other passage, go to Entry @JournalEntry[4Q8GPG7aA2857aQv]{#15}.</p>
