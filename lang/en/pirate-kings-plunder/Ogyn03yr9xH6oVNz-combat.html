<h3>Attacks and Damage</h3>
<p>In combat, both you and the enemy take turns attacking one another. You attack by rolling the 20-sided die (or d20 for short) and adding your attack bonus (which represents your skill at wielding a weapon). If the total is equal to or greater than the target's Armor Class (AC for short), then the attack is a hit and deals damage. Subtract the damage from the target's Hit Points (HP for short). To defeat them, you must reduce their to 0 HP or less.</p>
<p>On their turn, your enemy will likely attack you- you'll roll a d20 for them, add their attack bonus, and compare the result to your AC. If the enemy reduces you to 0 HP or less, you die.</p>
<p>Finally, if your attack roll exceeds the enemy's AC by 10 or more, it's a critical hit and you deal double damage (roll once, and double the result). You also score a critical hit against the enemy if the result of the die roll shows a "20" on the die. When the enemy attacks you, it can score a critical hit only if the die roll is a 20.</p>
<h3>Rounds and Actions</h3>
<p>Combat occurs in rounds. In each round, both you and the enemy take turns, and on each turn, you can use 3 actions. Once you have used your actions, it's the enemy's turn. After it uses 3 actions, it's your turn again. This repeats until one side is defeated. Actions are denoted by the action symbol ([one-action]).</p>
<p>Although you can attack three times in one turn, each time you attack in a single round, each subsequent attack becomes less accurate. For instance, your first Shortsword attack is rolled with a +7 bonus, but your second only has +2.</p>
