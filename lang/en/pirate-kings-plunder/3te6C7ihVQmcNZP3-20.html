<p class="box-text narrative">Using your blade, you begin to hack away at the icicle, but the first time you strike it, a wave of powerful, magical cold washes up your arm.</p>
<p>You take 1 damage. It looks like if you want to destroy the icicle, youâ€™ll need to hit it at least three more times, taking another 3 damage.</p>
<p>If you decide to destroy the icicle with your sword, take 3 more damage and go to Entry @JournalEntry[pABtZI2SaU7Q5aGP]{#02}.</p>
<p>If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, go to Entry @JournalEntry[0KrnycmJ3gpMxZCb]{#17}.</p>
<p>If you decide to leave the icicle alone and jump down the chute, go to Entry @JournalEntry[f8n0LQLyX36kNDZ8]{#23}.</p>
<p>If you instead decide to head back the way you came and try the other passage, go to Entry @JournalEntry[mz1Ezspf7RwqusCz]{#05}.</p>
