<p class="box-text narrative">You leap aside, avoiding the wolf’s snarling jaws and drive your sword deep into its flank. With a yowl, the wretched creature falls into the muck and goes still. You clean off your blade then wander into the cave to make sure that this wolf was the only one.<br /><br />As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you find yourself inside a small cavern that was obviously the beast’s home. It stinks of wet fur, and there are scraps of rotting meat and bone lying about—evidence of its previous victims. Far more interesting, though, is what you spot at the back of the cave.<br /><br />A crack in the far wall leads into darkness, and just above it, scratched into stone, is a symbol that looks a lot like a treasure chest. As you draw closer, you realize the crack is actually the entrance to an underground tunnel- it might just be the hiding place of some forgotten treasure.</p>
