<h3>Landmarks</h3>
<p>Otari’s largest temple is built at the town’s westernmost edge, atop an upraised shelf that’s nevertheless far below the clifftop. The library’s position allows it to catch the rays of the rising sun, which transform its central dome into a brilliantly glowing testament to the sun goddess Sarenrae—at least when the sky is clear.</p>
<p>While principally dedicated to Sarenrae, the Dawnflower Library welcomes all non-evil faiths. The building’s two wings contain shrines, and the center houses a wide range of books, including histories, satires, textbooks, and maps to innumerable exciting locales.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>The head priestess of Otari’s largest temple, the Dawnflower Library, is a chatty woman named Vandy Banderdash. Always eager to greet newcomers, regardless of their faith or vocation, Vandy has a surprising knack for recommending the perfect bit of reading to people she’s only just met. She’s open-minded on almost every subject, but has no patience for thievery, as her sister stole several valuable books from the temple and fled not long ago. Vandy is a useful contact for any hero, especially clerics.</p>

<h3>Goods and Services</h3>
<p>Otari’s largest temple contains more than ordinary books; the clerics also sell scrolls of cleric spells, wands with cleric spells, and +1 magic weapons. True to her reputation of being unusually knowledgeable, the high priestess Vandy Banderdash can often direct visitors to exactly the scroll or weapon they need.</p>
<p>The clerics here can also cast spells for the heroes, such as healing magic: a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heal} spell or another 1st-level cleric spell costs 3 gp, while heal level 2 or another 2nd-level cleric spell costs 7 gp. Heroes need to meet the clerics at the Dawnflower Library to receive such services, though; the clerics are much too busy with their daily duties to travel alongside the heroes.</p>
