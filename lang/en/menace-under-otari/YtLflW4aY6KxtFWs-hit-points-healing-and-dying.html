<p>Your maximum Hit Points represents your health, wherewithal, and heroic drive when you’re in good health and rested. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your current Hit Points.</p>
<p>Some spells, items, and other effects can heal you, and resting overnight heals you, too. When you’re healed, you regain Hit Points equal to the amount healed. You usually can’t go above your maximum Hit Points.</p>
<h2>Getting Knocked Out</h2>
<p>Creatures can’t have fewer than 0 Hit Points. Most enemies who fall to 0 Hit Points die or are destroyed. This removes them from play. If the attack was nonlethal, though, the enemy doesn’t die, and they’re instead knocked out for a significant amount of time (usually 1 minute or more).</p>
<p>Heroes, on the other hand, don’t automatically die when they reach 0 Hit Points! Instead, they’re knocked out—but they’re still at risk of death.</p>
<p>Two special conditions come into play in when you’re knocked out.</p>
<p>@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying}: This condition includes a number that measures how close you are to death. You die when you reach dying 4!</p>
<p>@Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded}: When you get knocked out and come back, you’re in greater danger. The wounded condition makes your dying condition get worse faster.</p>
<p>When you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points, you’re knocked out with the following effects.</p>
<p>• Immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.</p>
<p>• You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying 1} condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead. If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or effect, you don’t gain the dying condition; you instead gain the unconscious condition and have 0 Hit Points.</p>
<p>• You fall down and drop what you’re holding. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} condition and the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} condition. The unconscious condition is described in the sidebar. You can’t lose the unconscious condition while you have 0 HP.</p>
<h3>Dying</h3>
<p>If you ever reach dying 4 for any reason, you die immediately. If you take damage while you already have the dying condition, you increase your dying value by 1, or by 2 if the damage came from an attacker’s critical hit or your own critical failure. If you ever go from 0 HP to 1 HP or more, you automatically lose the dying condition and wake up. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded condition, described below.</p>
<p>When you have the dying condition, at the start of each of your turns, you must attempt a @JournalEntry[IpshSeAFYWe1xNaU]{Flat Check} (a d20 roll without adding anything) against a DC equal to 10 + your current dying value to see if you get better or worse. This is called a recovery check. Use the following effects for your recovery check result.</p>
<p class="Stat-Blocks_Stat-Outcome"><strong>Critical Success</strong>: Reduce your dying value by 2.</p>
<p class="Stat-Blocks_Stat-Outcome"><strong>Success</strong>: Reduce your dying value by 1.</p>
<p class="Stat-Blocks_Stat-Outcome"><strong>Failure</strong>: Increase your dying value by 1.</p>
<p class="Stat-Blocks_Stat-Outcome"><strong>Critical Failure</strong>: Increase your dying value by 1. If you have the wounded condition, you die immediately.</p>
<h3>Recovering</h3>
<p>If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check, you’re still at 0 Hit Points and remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} condition. As with any time you recover from dying, you gain the wounded condition.</p>
<h3>Wounded</h3>
<p>When you have the dying condition and lose it, regardless of the reason, you gain the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded 1} condition. If you already had the wounded condition, increase its value by 1 when you lose the dying condition.</p>
<p>The wounded condition makes getting knocked out more dangerous: if you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase the dying condition’s value by your wounded value.</p>
<p>If you have enough time, you can get rid of the wounded condition. The condition goes away, regardless of its current value, if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you by using the Medicine skill to Treat Wounds or if you’re restored to your maximum Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.</p>
