<p>Pathfinder is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG)— an interactive story where one player, the Game Master (GM), sets the scene and presents challenges, while the other players each take the role of a hero and attempt to overcome those challenges. Every player contributes to the story by responding to situations according to the personality and abilities of their character, describing their actions as each scene leads into the next. You'll determine whether your hero succeeds or fails at the actions they attempt by rolling dice, which adds an element of chance, and then adding your hero's statistics, which represent their strengths.</p>
<h1>Narrating Actions</h1>
<p>Pathfinder’s about more than just numbers. You and your friends are cooperating to tell a story! As you prepare to use your actions, describe your character's attitude and what they want to get done. Talk about how you execute your attack or the flashy movement you use as you cast your spell. The GM can do the same for the monsters.</p>

<article>
<p>Pathfinder uses a set of six different kinds of dice. Each die has a different number of sides- four, six, eight, or more. The name of each die uses the letter "d" followed by the number of sides on the die.</p>
<p>When the game tells you to roll multiple dice, the number before the "d" tells you how many of that die to roll. For example, "4d6" means you should roll a d6 four times and add the results together. Sometimes you'll add a number to the total from your die roll, and sometimes you'll subtract a number from the total.</p>
<p>In Foundry Virtual Tabletop, you can manually roll any of these numbers by entering a command such as <strong>/r 1d20</strong> in the chat window, allowing you to quickly replicate the act of rolling a die (or any number of dice) without the need for physical dice to roll. For more information, you can read more about dice in the linked article above. Since the official Pathfinder Second Edition game system provides a lot of automated features to make dice rolling faster and easier, many die rolls associated with particular actions can be performed by simply clicking a button on your character sheet.</p>

<h2>Example of Play</h2>
<p>Jason is the Game Master (GM), running a game for Logan, Lyz, and Mark. Logan is playing Kyra, a human cleric; Lyz is playing Valeros, a human fighter; and Mark is playing Ezren, a human wizard. The adventurers have become lost in a haunted forest while searching for a mysterious tower.</p>
<p><strong>Kyra</strong>: Are you sure we’re going the right way?</p>
<p><strong>Valeros</strong>: I think so. Can I figure out if we’re still heading in the right direction?</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Sure, why don’t you roll a Survival skill check?</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Lyz rolls a d20 and gets a 16. She then checks Valeros’s character sheet and sees that he has +5 for Survival, so she adds that to the roll.</p>
<p><strong>Valeros</strong>: Not too bad, I got a 21!</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: After looking at the ground for tracks and checking the underbrush, you’re pretty sure you haven’t been this way before. Something unusual lies ahead: the forest canopy is consumed by fog.</p>
<p><strong>Ezren</strong>: Fog, only up in the treetops? I don’t like the look of that. There might be some sort of magic up there. I cast the spell detect magic to see if I sense anything nearby.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Jason checks his notes for the adventure, and confirms that there is no magic up ahead, just one big, angry spider!</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: You extend your senses into the arcane, but you don’t detect any unusual magic nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Valeros</strong>: Hmm, I still don’t like the look of this. I get out my longsword and shield, and then move forward.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Very good. As you draw near, everything becomes clear. The fog in the trees is actually a mass of thick webs, draped from tree to tree in dense sheets.</p>
<p><strong>Ezren</strong>: Oh no! I hate spiders.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: As soon as you say that, a huge spider drops from the tree directly in front of you, mandibles clicking. I need everyone to roll Perception for initiative.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their Perception to the number on the die. Jason does the same for the spider and then puts the characters in order, from highest to lowest.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Alright, Valeros has the highest initiative and gets to go first. You have 3 actions.</p>
<p><strong>Valeros</strong>: Awesome! First I’m going to raise my shield to protect me from the spider, but then I’m going to use my other 2 actions on Sudden Charge!</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Raising a Shield increases Valeros’s Armor Class by 2 until the start of his next turn. Sudden Charge lets him move up to twice his Speed and attack, all for just 2 actions. Lyz rolls a d20 for the attack and gets an 18. She sees that Valeros has +9 on longsword attacks, for a total of 27.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: A 27 is a hit! Go ahead and roll for damage.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">The spider’s AC is 17. Since Lyz’s roll was 10 or more higher than the AC, it’s a critical hit! Looking at the sheet, Lyz rolls a d8 for the longsword and adds 4, getting a total of 6. Because it’s a critical hit, she doubles that, dealing 12 damage!</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: You score a nasty hit, slicing off one of the spider’s many legs, but it’s still fighting. Kyra, you’re next to act.</p>
<p><strong>Kyra</strong>: We could use my deity’s help here. I call upon Sarenrae’s power and cast bless, which provides a +1 bonus to attack rolls to anyone standing next to me. With my final action, I draw my scimitar.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: You feel the magic wash out from you, guiding your allies. Unfortunately, the spider gets to act next! Valeros is right in front of it, so it reaches out to try and bite him!</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Jason rolls a d20 and adds the spider’s bite attack statistic, getting a 21—that’s more than enough to hit.</p>
<p><strong>Valeros</strong>: Uh-oh! I spend my reaction to block the attack with my shield!</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Shield Block is an ability that reduces the damage from the attack, but it can break the shield. Jason rolls the damage and reduces it by the shield’s Hardness value.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Even after your block, the spider still hits you for 2 damage, and its fangs are dripping with poison. Roll a Fortitude save!</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Lyz grabs the d20 and rolls the saving throw, which will tell her if Valeros resists the poison. The heroes are in some real trouble here! As the fight continues, everyone gets to take a turn, repeating this cycle until one side is victorious.</p>
