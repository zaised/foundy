<p>Otari is a small coastal town a few days' travel from the major city of Absalom. It's a good place to start a Pathfinder campaign, and you can use it as an example of how to create a settlement for your heroes to call home as they start their adventures.</p>
<h1>Otari</h1>
<p>Otari is a thriving, diverse lumber town and trade port with a storied past and its fair share of sinister secrets. Founded by a group of adventurers over 400 years ago, the town has weathered attacks from kobolds and strange monsters, economic woes and windfalls, and cycles of prosperity and strife. Today, the town is a prosperous community and one of the largest settlements along the coast, but outside groups have their eye on Otari's fortunes, and centuries-old threats still lie buried beneath the cobblestones!</p>

<p>Otari is nestled in a coastal valley between two looming cliffs. The Osprey River flows into the sea in the middle of this valley, and the sturdy stone to either side of this river supports hundreds of buildings and a deep harbor. Otari rarely floods, but the numerous caves, warrens, and channels dug beneath the town do so regularly.</p>
<p>Though day-to-day life in Otari resembles that in any small town, its skyline stands out due to the enormous waterwheel at its eastern edge, the ingenious and enormous flume that brings lumber down the cliffside for easy transportation, and a stunning library to the west. The town's location near a major highway and its long history as a home to various adventuring parties lead visitors and travelers alike to seek it out. Lively trade passing through means unusual wares (and even magic items) aren't too difficult to find.</p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>Just over 1,200 people live in Otari, drawn from all over the world. While most of these residents are humans, some dwarves and elves also live here. Most residents work in the local fishing and lumber industries. For the most part, people in Otari are friendly and welcoming, though they prefer its small-town feel and make lighthearted fun of visitors from big cities. Coffee is a mainstay, a favorite drink among the hardworking and early-rising townsfolk.</p>
<p>The current mayor of Otari is @JournalEntry[32FDd61iWY3rJwO4]{Oseph Menhemes}, patriarch of one of three local lumber companies and owner of Otari’s famous lumber flume and mill. Though dedicated to his role as a public servant, Oseph is ambitious and wants to expand the town’s lumber-processing capacities.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The biggest business in Otari is lumber, and three families control the industry. The largest operator is Otari Lumber, owned by Mayor Oseph Menhemes, which operates the massive @JournalEntry[fwd9NeqaYqVpBFTw]{Giant's Wheel} and the @JournalEntry[Vsf2B0lbQLYCx6s3]{Loading Flume}. Whistledown Cutters is Otari’s most financially successful lumber company due to the cunning business sense of its owner, Alymora Inkleholtz. Chertel Timber, the third company, has recently struggled due to a combination of poor management, labor issues in its lumber camps, and difficulties with financing.</p>
<p>All three lumber companies have a not-so-secret enemy in the Kortos Consortium, an externally based organization that wants to control the timber industry in Otari and many nearby communities. The Kortos Consortium isn’t above sabotage or worse to seize control of local interests. Heroes might find work for any of these lumber companies, often against the others!</p>

<h2>Local Connections</h2>
<p>A good way to connect heroes who grew up in or near Otari to the town is through their backgrounds.</p>
<p>Heroes with the acolyte background might have served in the @JournalEntry[if326ZRCeI3C3alq]{Dawnflower Library} and perhaps tended the Otari Graveyard, or they might have had a less-regulated religious upbringing with Magiloy at @JournalEntry[BKh019SpVI0dAmod]{Crow's Casks}.</p>
<p>Heroes with the criminal background might know Yinyasmera and be former (or current!) members of the @JournalEntry[vaHqR8tfA1dKqwXN]{Osprey Club}.</p>
<p>Deckhands or gamblers probably know Tamily Tanderveil at the @JournalEntry[f1HTHkFXB6oa1xcS]{Otari Fishery}, even though she hasn’t been in town long.</p>
<p>Scholars have likely studied alongside Morlibint at Odd’s Stories.</p>
<p>Warriors might have served in the @JournalEntry[yL7mnrZrOjsfXEZq]{Otari Guard} under Lardus Longsaddle (or his better-liked predecessor) or worked as muscle for one of the local lumber companies.</p>
