<p>You’ve identified the main aspects of your hero. Now it’s time to add the finishing touches!</p>
<p>Depending on if you're using the streamlined or full ruleset, your steps in this section will look slightly different. For instance, characters built using the full rules get four free ability boosts. However, in either case, this handout will explain how your character sheet calculates the numbers that correspond to the decisions you made during your journey through character creation. You'll also choose some final details, like your hero’s name and personality. Is your hero a champion of justice, or a sellsword who works for anyone who can pay the bills?</p>
<h3>Proficiency</h3>
<p>Many of these statistics include a proficiency bonus. If your hero’s proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, the proficiency bonus for that statistic equals your hero’s level + 2. If it’s expert, the proficiency bonus equals your hero’s level + 4. If your hero is untrained in that statistic, their proficiency bonus is +0.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Your hero’s Intelligence bonus determines how many skills they know, in addition to those they gained from their background and class. From the full list of @JournalEntry[ImGyOYVIN6WeuOT4]{Skills}, choose a number of skills equal to your hero’s Intelligence modifier to become trained in. Mark them as trained by clicking on the skill's proficiency button on the Skills tab of your character sheet.</p>
<h3>Perception</h3>
<p>While not a skill, Perception is calculated like one. Your hero’s Perception bonus measures their alertness and is equal to their proficiency bonus for Perception plus their Wisdom modifier.</p>

<h3>Saving Throws</h3>
<p>Add up the total for each of your hero’s three saving throws.</p>
<p><strong>Fortitude</strong>: Add their proficiency bonus for Fortitude saves plus their Constitution modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Reflex</strong>: Add their proficiency bonus for Reflex saves plus their Dexterity modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>: Add their proficiency bonus for Will saves plus their Wisdom modifier.</p>

<h3>Defenses</h3>
<p>Your hero’s Armor Class (AC) represents how difficult they are to hit in combat. To calculate AC, add 10 + your hero’s Dexterity (up to their armor’s Dexterity cap) + their proficiency bonus with the type of armor you chose + that armor’s item bonus to AC.</p>

<h3>Weapons and Attacks</h3>
<p>You’ll need to calculate your hero’s attack statistic for Strikes with each weapon they have and how much damage each Strike deals.</p>
<p>For each weapon’s attack, add your hero’s proficiency bonus for that weapon or type of weapon + their Strength for melee Strikes or Dexterity for ranged Strikes. If their Dexterity is higher and the melee weapon has the finesse trait, you can add Dexterity instead of Strength for that Strike.</p>
<p>You also need to calculate how much damage each weapon’s Strike deals. Melee weapons and ranged weapons that have the thrown trait add Strength to damage rolls. Other ranged weapons don’t usually add anything to the damage roll.</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>Your hero's @JournalEntry[ENyKNEGLOOT4GfO1]{Alignment} is a general indicator of their morality and how strongly they favor consistency or flexibility.</p>
<p>If you play a cleric, remember that your hero's alignment must be one allowed for their deity. Of course, depending on their personality or backstory, any character can worship a deity- they just don't gain powers from it. </p>

<h3>Name and Pronouns</h3>
<p>Don't forget to name your hero and decide on their pronouns- characters of all genders or no gender are equally likely to become adventurers. Record your hero's name and pronouns in the top section of your character sheet. If you'd like, you can also include a picture of your hero's appearance or write a description of what they look like section.</p>
