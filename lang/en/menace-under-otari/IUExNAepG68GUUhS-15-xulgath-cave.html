<p>This chamber is the den of a trio of xulgaths, which are smelly reptilian humanoids. Place the xulgath tokens as you'd like near the center of the cavern. Read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">There is an overpowering stench in this chamber, like rotten fish mixed with oily sweat. The warm, humid air only adds to the foul atmosphere. Unlike the previous chambers, this one appears to be a natural cavern, dotted with limestone stalactites and stalagmites, making it hard to see where the room ends.</p>
<p>The horrid stench in this room comes from the xulgaths and can make other creatures sick. Have each player roll a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:19]{Fortitude save} as soon as they enter the room. Anyone who succeeds can ignore the smell. A hero who fails this saving throw is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened}- they take a –1 status penalty to all their d20 rolls and DCs (including their Armor Class) until they spend an action to retch.</p>

<h2>Encounter</h2>

<article>
<p>The reptilian creatures in the center of the room are xulgaths, reptilian humanoids who dwell underground in large family groups called clutches, fighting others for territory and resources. They’re known for their aggressive nature and their horrid stench—which they’re immune to.</p>
<h3>Surprised Xulgaths</h3>
<p>These three xulgaths are bickering with each other over a piece of meat and haven’t noticed the heroes. Ask the players to roll for initiative while you roll Perception for the xulgaths’ initiative.</p>
<h3>Xulgath Tactics</h3>
<p>The xulgaths start off combat seated without their weapons drawn. Until they spend an action to Stand, they’re flat-footed (taking a –2 circumstance penalty to their Armor Class). They also have to spend an action to draw their clubs before they can attack. Once they’ve stood and drawn their clubs, the xulgaths move forward to attack with whatever actions they have left. The xulgaths fight until slain.</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>If the heroes defeat the xulgaths in this room, award each hero 120 XP.</p>

<h2>Treasure</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>After the fight, the heroes can check whether the xulgaths have any treasure. If they do, they find a small bag tied to the waist of one of the foul creatures. Inside the leather pouch is a handful of strange coins, minted in some faraway kingdom deep underground- the coins show a tower inside a cave on one side and a sinister-looking elf's head on the other. These coins amount to 38 sp and 4 gp.</p>
<p>This treasure isn't on a loot sheet- instead, these items are within the inventories of one of the Xulgaths! To allow your players to loot them, you need to have the setting "allow players to loot enemy combatants" enabled in your system configuration. Otherwise, you can always simply give them the coin manually.</p>

<h2>Passage into Darkness</h2>
<p>Two passages lead out of this room, other than the way the heroes came in. One leads off the map, heading steadily down, deep into the earth. This tunnel leads into the Darklands, a vast subterranean realm deep underground filled with all sorts of deadly creatures and sinister monsters. This is where the xulgaths came from, but it’s beyond the scope of this adventure.</p>
<p>If the heroes travel down this way, tell them that after an hour of travel, they see no sign of the creatures that broke into the fishery and should probably turn back before getting hopelessly lost. The Darklands are for more experienced adventurers, and the players should explore the surface more before delving into these lightless realms.</p>
<h2>Freshly Dug Tunnel</h2>
<p>The other passageway exiting this room looks like it was dug recently. This tunnel curves up and around before ending in a thin wall of loose stones and dirt. A tiny hole in the wall allows creatures to look into @JournalEntry[4re1eriShy04xSlB]{Area 17} beyond. If a hero peeks through the wall, they can see the kobolds in that area going about their daily routines. If they spend time listening to the kobolds’ chatter, the heroes overhear a few phrases, including “when we stole the egg” and “more fish for the pet.” A hero who wants to break open this wall can attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:20]{Athletics skill check}. On a success, they break down the wall! As before, you can run the @Macro[NAxPG4cHu4dKrx6h]{Area 15 - Freshly Dug Tunnel} macro by clicking on it.</p>
<p>On a failure, the wall remains intact, and the kobolds in the Kobold Warren notice the sound and prepare for a fight.</p>
