<h2>Reading Rules</h2>
<p>Throughout this module, statistics and actions like Strength and Strike are capitalized to help them stand out. Text that is formatted using italics refers to a spell or magic item, such as <em>light </em>or a <em>healing potion</em>, to help make it instantly recognizable.</p>
</aside>
<p>You'll see game terms like "saving throw" and "Hit Points" as you create a hero and start playing the game. You need only a general idea of these terms for now, and they’re explained more later on.</p>
<h3>Armor Class (AC)</h3>
<p>This number is the Difficulty Class for an attack. It represents how hard it is to hit a hero or a monster in combat.</p>
<h3>Attack</h3>
<p>When a creature tries to harm another creature, it makes a Strike or uses some other attack action. A success on the roll for that action is called a hit, and a critical success is sometimes called a critical hit. A hero might Strike with a weapon or their fist, grapple with their hands, or attack with a spell. Attacking more than once on your turn gets harder with each attack, giving you a penalty called a multiple attack penalty.</p>
<h3>Bonuses and Penalties</h3>
<p>Bonuses and penalties apply to checks and certain statistics. There are several types of bonuses and penalties. If you have more than one bonus of the same type, you use only the highest one. Likewise, you use only the worst penalty of each type.</p>
<h3>Condition</h3>
<p>An ongoing effect that changes how a creature can act, or that alters some of their statistics, is called a condition.</p>
<h3>Durations</h3>
<p>Some actions have effects that last longer than the actions themselves. These effects are measured by a duration. Something might last until the end of your next turn, for 1 minute, or for other lengths. Once the duration is over, the effect ends.</p>
<p>When a duration is measured in rounds, the remaining duration decreases by 1 at the start of each turn of the creature that created the effect. If you need to track something that lasts 1 minute in combat, 1 minute is 10 rounds. Most fights don’t last that long, so you might not need to worry about it! Some durations last until certain things happen or stop happening, instead of a certain amount of time.</p>
<h3>Feat</h3>
<p>A feat is an ability your hero can use. It might come from their ancestry, background, or class. Some feats grant the ability to use special actions.</p>
<h3>Hit Points (HP)</h3>
<p>Hit Points represent how badly injured a creature can be before it falls unconscious and begins dying. Damage decreases Hit Points on a 1-to-1 basis, while healing restores Hit Points at the same rate.</p>
<h3>Level</h3>
<p>A level is a number that measures overall power. The rules in this book can take a hero to 3rd level, and those in the Core Rulebook elevate them into living legends all the way to 20th level! Spells, items, and other rules elements also have levels, telling you how powerful they are compared to one another.</p>
<h3>Nonplayer Character (NPC)</h3>
<p>A nonplayer character is controlled by the GM. NPCs interact with players and help advance the story.</p>
<h3>Perception</h3>
<p>Perception measures your hero's ability to notice hidden objects or unusual situations and usually determines how quickly they spring into action in combat.</p>
<h3>Proficiency</h3>
<p>Proficiency measures your hero’s aptitude for each statistic and adds a bonus to that statistic. It has three ranks: untrained, trained, and expert. If you're untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0. If you’re trained, your proficiency bonus equals your level plus 2, and if you’re an expert, your proficiency bonus equals your level plus 4.</p>
<h3>Round</h3>
<p>A round is a period of time during an encounter in which all participants get a chance to act. A combat round represents approximately 6 seconds in the world of the game.</p>
<h3>Saving Throw (Save)</h3>
<p>Some dangerous effects let you attempt a saving throw to mitigate their harm. You attempt a saving throw automatically—you don’t have to use an action or a reaction. There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (to resist diseases, poisons, and physical effects), Reflex (to evade effects a creature could quickly dodge), and Will (to resist effects that target the mind and personality).</p>
<h3>Basic Saving Throw</h3>
<p>Some spells use a "basic saving throw". These work like any other save but use the same degrees of success:</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> The creature takes no damage.</p>
<p><strong>Success:</strong> The creature takes half the listed damage.</p>
<p><strong>Failure: </strong>The creature takes the full listed damage.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> The creature takes double the listed damage.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>Speed is the distance a creature can move using a single action.</p>
<h3>Trait</h3>
<p>A trait is a keyword that appears on an action so other rules can interact with it by referencing the trait. For instance, a fighter can make an Attack of Opportunity against someone who uses an action with the manipulate or move trait, and an abjurer wizard can prepare an extra spell with the abjuration trait. Traits appear in boxes beneath the title of a rules element, or in parentheses following an action in a stat block.</p>
