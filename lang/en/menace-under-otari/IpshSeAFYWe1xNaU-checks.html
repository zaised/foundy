<p>When your hero tries to do something and the outcome is uncertain, you’ll roll a check to see whether you succeed. Pathfinder has many types of checks, from skill checks to attack rolls to saving throws, but they all follow the basic steps explained below: roll the d20, calculate your result, and compare that result to a target number called a difficulty class (DC) to determine whether you succeed or fail.</p>
<p>All checks use the same formula:</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">d20 + statistic + bonuses and penalties = result</p>
<p>Checks and DCs both come in many forms. When you swing a sword at a monster, you’ll make an attack roll, and its Armor Class is the DC. If you leap across a chasm, you’ll attempt an Athletics skill check with a DC based on how far you’re trying to jump. When trying to remember information about an ancient text, you’ll roll a skill check to Recall Knowledge with a skill and DC determined by the GM.</p>
<p>These are some common types of checks and DCs:</p>

<h1>Rolling a Check</h1>

<h2>Step 1: Roll</h2>
<p>Start by rolling your d20! Pay attention to whether you rolled a 20 or a 1 on the die because that does something special when you determine success or failure.</p>
</article>
<article class="full">
<h2>Step 2: Calculate the Result</h2>
<p>Add the number you rolled on the d20 to the statistic you’re using (such as your attack bonus or your Stealth), and add any special bonuses and penalties that apply. This total is your result.</p>
<h3>Bonuses and Penalties</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll have a bonus or penalty to add to your roll in addition to the statistic you’re using. For instance, a spell might give you a bonus to an attack roll. Such a bonus might be labeled, like a circumstance bonus, status bonus, or item bonus. You can benefit from only the highest bonus with a given label. For example, if two spells are affecting you, each giving you a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, your total status bonus would still just be +1, not +2. This works the same way for multiple circumstance or item bonuses, too. But if you get a +1 status bonus and a +1 circumstance bonus to an attack roll, you add both! Penalties can have labels too, and they work the same way, except that the number is negative.</p>
<p>Anything without a label is cumulative. For example, the penalty for making multiple attacks in a round and the penalty for attacking at a long range with a ranged weapon don’t have labels, so both would apply to an attack that wasn’t your first of the round and was made at a long range.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Determine Success</h2>
<p>Often, it’s important to determine not only if you succeed or fail, but also how spectacularly you succeed or fail. Exceptional results can cause you to critically succeed or critically fail.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You exceed the DC by 10 or more.</p>
<p><strong>Success: </strong>You meet or exceed the DC.</p>
<p><strong>Failure: </strong>Your result is lower than the DC.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure: </strong>Your result is lower than the DC by 10 or more.</p>
<p>The action you’re using tells you what happens depending on how well you rolled. For instance, if you attacked with a Strike, you’d deal double damage on a critical success, the normal amount of damage on a success, and no damage at all on a failure or critical failure. If an action doesn’t say anything special happens on a critical failure, a critical failure has the same result as a regular failure. For a Strike, a critical failure is no different from a regular failure. Likewise, if an action doesn’t say something special happens on a critical success, it has the same effect as a success.</p>
<h3>Rolling a 20 or a 1</h3>
<p>Rolling the highest or lowest number on a d20 has some special rules.</p>
<p><strong>If you roll a 20 on the d20</strong>, use a result one step better than what you’d normally get based on your roll. This changes a critical failure to a failure, a failure to a success, and a success to a critical success. Usually, this means you critically succeed!</p>
<p><strong>If you roll a 1 on the d20</strong>, do the opposite and use a result one step worse. This changes a critical success to a success, a success to a failure, and a failure to a critical failure. Usually, this means you critically fail.</p>

<h2>Saving Throws</h2>
<p>Saving throws, or saves, are checks that let you shrug off harmful effects, such as those of enemies’ spells. An ability that lets you attempt a save says so in its text. These checks are automatic—you don’t need to use a reaction to attempt one.</p>
<p>There are three types of saving throw: Fortitude saves for overcoming something through your body’s endurance, Reflex saves for quickly dodging, and Will saves for mentally resisting something.</p>
<h3>Basic Saving Throws</h3>
<p>Some spells and other effects that deal damage ask you to roll a basic saving throw. You roll a basic saving throw like any other save, but you’ll use the following outcomes to determine how much damage you take.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong>: You take no damage.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: You take half the listed damage.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: You take the full listed damage.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong>: You take double the listed damage.</p>
<h2>Calculating DCs</h2>
<p>For many checks, you’ll compare your result to another creature’s DC, with Strikes, the DC of your attack roll is your target’s Armor Class (AC). Sometimes an enemy’s check uses your DC, like comparing the result of an Intimidation check to Demoralize you to your Will DC. If you need a DC for something that’s normally a statistic, such as a Will DC, just add 10 to the statistic to get the DC. For example, a creature with a Will of +5 has a Will DC of 15.</p>
<p>For other checks, like an Athletics check to Climb a steep cliff, the Game Master sets the DC for you. They have information on how to do so in the @JournalEntry[KK8PMGKZe2sLnhCS] handout.</p>
<h2>Special Rules for Checks</h2>
<p>Some types of checks follow special rules.</p>
<h3>Flat Checks</h3>
<p>When something’s based purely on chance, you’ll attempt a flat check. A flat check never includes any modifiers, bonuses, or penalties—you just roll a d20 and compare the result on the die to the DC.</p>
<h3>Secret Checks</h3>
<p>The secret trait appears on anything that uses secret checks. You use the normal formula for the check, but the GM rolls the d20 in secret. Instead of revealing the result, the GM simply describes the information or effects determined by the check’s result.</p>
<h3>Helping Someone</h3>
<p>You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} someone when they attempt a skill check or attack roll to potentially give them a bonus. This requires preparing to help them, usually by spending an action or more on your turn, then using a reaction when they attempt their skill check or attack roll. When you use your reaction, attempt a skill check or attack roll, usually the same type of roll as the one you’re trying to help.</p>
<h3>Attacks</h3>
<p>Anything that has the attack trait follows some special rules. You can read about @JournalEntry[k60WZPFTwRqW0cPg] here.</p>
