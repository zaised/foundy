<p>Playlists provide a variety of ways to give your players audio cues or help set the mood for your scene. While there are specific instructions for how to handle the on-scene Ambient Sounds when your players first encounter them, there is an expectation that you will know when an ambient sound is playing and disable it by right-clicking when appropriate.Â </p>

<h2>Using Playlists</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>As a GM, you have exclusive control over the soundscape your players experience within Foundry VTT. The playlists tab in the sidebar can be conveniently popped out into its own window by right-clicking its icon (the music notes) in the sidebar. The tracklist and their intended uses are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Ambience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploration Loops</strong> (Simultaneous) - contains subtly looping audio to add some atmosphere to the act of exploring. They can be played individually, but clicking play on the playlist activates all three simultaneously, providing a soundscape with a faint bass drone of being underground, periodic wet drips to indicate a seaside cavern structure, and the sounds of rodents chittering and scratching.</li>
<li><strong>Floor 1 Exploration Ambience</strong> - This playlist only contains a single audio file, a looping string of dramatic piano notes to add some musical themes of sneaky exploration. It is best used in conjunction with other ambience playlists.</li>
<li><strong>Floor 2 Exploration Ambience</strong> - This playlist only contains a single audio file, a looping drone meant to convey the feeling of exploring a cavern deeper underground. It is best used in conjunction with other ambience playlists.</li>
<li><strong>Floor 2 Mermaid Fountain</strong> - a faint ominous drone and amplified sounds of running water which, when coupled with the on-scene Ambient sounds of water running should provide a clear audio cue to players that something might be wrong and dangerous with the fountain.</li>
<li><strong>Floor 2 Soggy Crossroads</strong> - This playlist should be used when players breach the barricade shortly after entering the second floor, as they near the water. It mixes the faint exploration piano from the first floor with heavy sounds of running water.</li>
<li><strong>Otari Fishery </strong>- The goal of this track is to convey the sounds of a busy and bustling establishment, with drink and games served and the sounds of workers. It should be used when the players speak with Tamily.</li>
<li><strong>Otari Wharf</strong> - A mix of sea birds and ocean waves to draw the players imagination to the sounds of a seaside town.</li>
<li><strong>Soundboard Loops</strong> - This is a soundboard containing looping tracks which can be drawn upon to evoke particular sound effects. For example, during the encounter with the Cinder Rat you may wish to play the "Everything is Fire" track until the rat is defeated, or when your players breach the first barricade to explore northward, you may wish to begin playing "The Malevolent Dead".</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)"><strong>Sound Effects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barricades </strong>- these are the sound effect tracks which occur when players are removing the barricades, and can be replayed from here if the players miss out on hearing them.</li>
<li><strong>Dragon Soundboard</strong> - Intended for use while players move into the Mushroom Grotto, these effects allow you to indicate the presence of a dragon and then, as combat begins, the sounds of the dragon attacking or being injured.</li>
<li><strong>The Cinder Rat</strong> - The sound effect which plays when the Cinder Rat explodes out of the orb in @JournalEntry[X3d3lzoGP2TbWjpV]{14: Elements of Chaos}</li>
</ul>
