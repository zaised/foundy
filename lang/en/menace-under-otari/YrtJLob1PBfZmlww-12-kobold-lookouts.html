<h3>Floor Two</h3>
<p>The challenges in the second level of the dungeon are more dangerous than those in the first level. In their explorations of this level, the players will learn the truth behind the missing fish. A band of kobolds under the city has recently hatched a green dragon wyrmling, and have been raiding the Otari Fishery to provide a steady diet for their growing charge. If the heroes don’t defeat this menace, the dragon might grow up to spell doom for the town of Otari!</p>
<p>The players will have to use all their skills and abilities if they hope to defeat the kobolds—and the dragon. As with the first level, unless noted otherwise, the chambers in this level aren’t lit. The kobolds all have darkvision and have little need for light.</p>

<p>If you haven't already done so, activate the second level of the map to bring your players' focus to it, and place down their heroes' tokens on the staircase in this area.</p>
<p>The kobolds prepared this room to defend against any intruders and stationed two of their more capable guards to defend this place. Because they're hiding, don't reveal their tokens just yet. When the heroes descend the spiral staircase, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">The stairs spiral down deep into the earth before ending in a chamber that looks like it’s been prepared specifically to defend against intruders. On one side of the room, a table has been turned on its side to provide cover, while on the other, crates and barrels have been piled up to create a second barrier.</p>
<h3>Hidden Kobolds</h3>
<p>The kobold scouts begin this encounter hidden. Ask each player to tell you their Perception DC: their Perception + 10. Then roll a d20 and add the kobolds' Stealth. If the total is equal to or higher than the highest Perception DC from the heroes, the heroes don't notice the kobolds before they attack- the room looks like it's empty! Don't reveal the tokens on the map until the kobolds attack or they move out from behind their barricades, or until a hero moves around the barricades enough to see a hiding kobold. But if any hero's Perception DC is higher than the total of the kobold's Stealth check, the kobolds are spotted! Reveal their tokens on the map.</p>
<p>Either way, ask the players to roll initiative (using Perception unless a hero was hiding). Use the total from the kobolds' Stealth check for their initiative. If any heroes have their turn before the kobolds but the kobolds successfully hid themselves, the heroes know there are foes nearby, but they don't know where- they'll have to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} to find their enemies.</p>

<h3>Kobold Tactics</h3>
<p>If a kobold's turn starts while they're hidden, they fire their crossbow at a hero. That character has the flat-footed condition against the attack, which gives them a -2 status penalty to AC and allows the kobold to deal extra damage from their sneak attack ability. After this ranged Strike, the kobold is no longer hidden (reveal their tokens if you haven't already), and the fight proceeds normally.</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>For overcoming the kobolds in this room, award each hero 80 XP.</p>

<h2>Smelly Barricade</h2>
<aside class="bb-float-block">
<h3>Audio Cue</h3>
<p>After your players breach the barricade, you may wish to start the Floor 2 Soggy Crossroads playlist. This will provide your players with the sounds of running water and denote a change in atmosphere.</p>
</aside>
<p>There is a makeshift barricade in the back of this room. If the heroes examine this barricade, ask for a @Check[type:perception|dc:10]{Perception Check}. If the total is 10 or higher, they notice a foul stench coming from the passage behind the barricade—like rotten fish and sweat. If the total is 20 or higher, they also hear a faint sound of dripping water coming from somewhere in the distance.</p>
<p>If the heroes take this barricade apart, ask them if they tear it down or carefully disassemble it before you open the pathway-just like in @JournalEntry[YAfr3rITEAgMznAS]{Area 04}. The creatures in the other rooms are too far away to hear any noise the heroes make, but the heroes have no way of knowing that!</p>
<p>Again, just like in Area 04, we've provided another macro you can use to automatically dismantle the barricade. To run it, just click @Macro[pb7k8V9m7cFioy6B]{Area 12 - Barricade}.</p>
