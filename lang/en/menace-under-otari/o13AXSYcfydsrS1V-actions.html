<p>A hero affects the world by using actions. Some actions, called basic actions, can be used by anyone—@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride}, and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} are all basic actions. Others, like spells and special abilities, can be used only by certain characters. Each action produces an effect. Some do this automatically, but for others you’ll roll to determine the effect.</p>

<h3>Action Icons</h3>
<p>You’ll see the following icons used for the different types of actions found throughout the game.</p>
<p><span class="pf2-icon">1</span> Single actions are the simplest and most common actions. You can use 3 single actions on your turn, in any order you want.</p>
<p><span class="pf2-icon">r </span>Reactions are special actions that you can use when it isn’t your turn. Each reaction has a trigger that specifies when you can use that reaction. You can use only 1 reaction per round.</p>
<p>Activities take longer than a single action. Activities that use 2 actions have this symbol:  <span class="pf2-icon">2</span>. Activities that use 3 actions—your whole turn—have this symbol <span class="pf2-icon">3</span>. Some activities take even longer, and you can use them only when you’re between combat encounters.</p>

<h1>Actions</h1>
<p>During an encounter, the things you can do are represented by actions.</p>
<p>Single actions <span class="pf2-icon">1</span> can be completed in a very short time. Their effects are simple, and all of the effects happen within that single action.</p>
<p>Activities take longer and represent multiple single actions. Activities use symbols if they take 2 actions <span class="pf2-icon">2</span> or 3 actions <span class="pf2-icon">3</span>. During combat, you can’t split an activity over multiple turns, so it’s not possible to, for example, spend 1 action for a <span class="pf2-icon">2</span> spell on one turn and complete it on the next. Activities that take longer than 3 actions say so in the text and don’t have an icon. You can’t use such actions in combat because you can’t complete them in a single turn. An activity might contain single actions within it, such as making a Strike as part of the activity. These sub-actions work just like they do normally. For instance, the Sudden Charge activity has a fighter Stride twice, then Strike—but it costs only 2 actions to do it all, instead of 3!</p>
<p>Reactions <span class="pf2-icon">r</span> can be used any time their special trigger happens, whether it’s your turn or not. Reactions are usually triggered by other creatures or by events outside your control. All fighters have the Attack of Opportunity reaction, but not every character has an ability to spend their reaction on. You don’t have to use a reaction when its trigger comes up if you don’t want to. In an encounter, you get only 1 reaction each round, so you can’t react more than once per round. Outside of encounters, your use of reactions is more flexible and up to the GM.</p>
<h2>Basic Actions</h2>
<p>Every creature can do common tasks using basic actions. You’ll @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.UHpkTuCtyaPqiCAB]{Step}, @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Bcxarzksqt9ezrs6]{Stride}, and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} a great deal. Many feats and other actions tell you to use one of these basic actions or modify them to produce different effects. For example, a large number of activities include a Strike.</p>
<p>As long as you can act, you can also speak without spending any actions. You can usually speak a single sentence or so per round. Sign language works the same way, but you need free hands to do it, and the recipient of your message needs to see you rather than hear you. Special uses of speech, such as attempting a Deception skill check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie}, require spending actions and follow their own rules.</p>
<h2>Actions While Exploring</h2>
<p>When you’re not in an encounter, you don’t have to track when you get your 3 actions and reaction, though you can still use actions and reactions as needed. The GM tells you how much time you have to get things done and determine what actions and reactions you can use if there’s confusion. Activities with the exploration trait take a long time to carry out, so you can use them only outside of encounters.</p>
