<p>When you’re in a tense fight and every individual action counts, you enter an encounter. Time is divided into rounds, each of which is 6 seconds of time in the game world. (Ten rounds is 1 minute.) Every round, each creature in that combat takes a turn in an established order called initiative. An encounter takes place following these four steps.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Roll Initiative</h2>
<p>When the encounter starts, the GM calls for initiative. Roll your Perception (unless you were Avoiding Notice in the lead-up to the battle, in which case you roll Stealth). The GM rolls initiative for anyone other than the heroes in the encounter. Unlike a typical check, where the result is compared to a DC, the results of initiative rolls are ranked from highest to lowest.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Play a Round</h2>
<p>The round starts with the creature who rolled the highest initiative taking their turn first. The process of taking a turn is described below.</p>
<p>Once the first creature has taken their turn, the one with the next highest initiative takes their turn, and so on. If initiative results are tied, enemies go before the heroes. If creatures on the same side tie, they choose what order to go the first time their initiative comes up. After that, everyone’s place in the initiative order doesn’t change for the rest of that encounter.</p>
<p>Once everyone has taken a turn, the round ends, and the next one begins.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Begin the Next Round</h2>
<p>Initiative is like a clock—after all combatants have taken their turns, you’ll start a new round. Go back to the highest initiative number and everyone takes another turn in the same order in the new round.</p>

<h2>Step 4: End the Encounter</h2>
<p>When everyone on one side is defeated, some sort of truce is reached, or another event or circumstance stops the combat, the encounter ends. You and the other participants no longer follow the initiative order, and the game returns to exploration.</p>
<p>At the end of an encounter, the GM may award Experience Points to the party, or you may find treasure to divvy up.</p>

<h1>Taking Your Turn</h1>
<p>When it reaches your initiative in combat, you get to take your turn! You can use your actions on your turn, and some special rules apply at the start and end of your turn. Here’s what you do during each part of your turn.</p>
<h2>Start of Your Turn</h2>
<p>• If you created an effect with a duration lasting a certain number of rounds, like many spells do, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. The effect ends if the duration is reduced to 0.</p>
<p>• If you’re dying, roll a recovery check (see @JournalEntry[YtLflW4aY6KxtFWs]{Hit Points, Healing, and Dying}).</p>
<p>• Lose the reaction from your previous turn, and regain your 3 actions and 1 reaction. You can’t “save up” unused actions or reactions from previous turns. If a condition or effect prevents you from using some, but not all, of your actions, you still regain the remaining actions. If a condition or effect prevents you from using all of your actions, you don’t regain any actions or your reaction.</p>
<h2>Using Actions</h2>
<p>• Now that you have your actions, it’s time to use them! You can perform your actions in any order you wish, but you have to complete one before beginning another. For example, you couldn’t Strike while in the middle of a Stride unless a special activity lets you. You can pick your actions from the basic actions available to all characters as well as any actions you get from your class, ancestry, equipment, or any other choices you made during character creation.</p>
<p>• Once you’re done spending actions, go to the end of your turn.</p>
<h2>End of Your Turn</h2>
<p>• Lose any of your 3 actions that remain. You keep your reaction if you didn’t use it on your turn; you lose it at the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>• If you are suffering @JournalEntry[BmyKEDSSROeZktZE]{Persistent Damage}, you take the damage at this time. After taking the damage, you can attempt the flat check to end the persistent damage.</p>
<p>• End any effects that last until the end of your turn.</p>
<p>• Resolve anything else specified to happen at the end of your turn.</p>
<p>• Your turn is over, and the next creature’s turn begins.</p>
