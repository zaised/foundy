<p>This chamber houses the majority of the kobold band dwelling here. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">As the door opens, the smell of rotten fish and mold wafts out. On the west side of this vast room is a large table with benches on either side. Old food scraps, dirty knives, and broken plates cover the table. Off to the east side, burrows have been dug into the wall to make small sleeping chambers filled with straw mats. This must be the kobolds' warren!</p>
<h3>Kobold Placement</h3>
<p>The kobolds beneath Otari have claimed this chamber as their home. Six of them are here, but their exact location depends on the heroes’ actions in other areas. If the heroes made lots of noise breaking through the wall between this area and the (@JournalEntry[IUExNAepG68GUUhS]{Xulgath den}) or by destroying the mechanisms for the mermaid fountain trap (@JournalEntry[H7G0kGC4VF0JJ4SO]{Area 16}), place all six of the kobolds in the center of the room, ready to attack. If the heroes were quiet, the kobolds are relaxing when the heroes enter. Place three of them at the table, and put the other three in the sleeping alcoves.</p>
<p>Wherever the kobolds are, they're not happy about having visitors. They spring to attack! Ask each player to roll initiative, and roll Perception once to determine when the kobolds get their turn.</p>
<p>The kobolds don’t focus on any one character. Pairs of kobolds might try to flank one hero to use their sneak attack, while others use the unconventional tactics described below.</p>
<p>While fighting the heroes, the kobolds boast of their mighty lineage and combined power, assuring the “soft-skin” heroes that they’ll surely come to regret trespassing into the kobolds’ domain. However, they remain just as cowardly as the kobolds the heroes have already defeated in these caverns.</p>
<p>Unlike all the foes the heroes have faced so far, the last remaining kobold tries to surrender.</p>

<h3>Unconventional Tactics</h3>
<p>These kobolds use tactics in their fight, such as attempting to flank the heroes whenever possible. Since this is their home, they have a few other tricks they can use against the heroes. Use these throughout the fight to add variety and keep the players on their toes!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bed Cover</strong>: A kobold in one of the sleeping chambers can spend 1 action to pull a sleeping mat off the floor and hide behind it. Doing so grants the kobold @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-effects.I9lfZUiCwMiGogVi]{Lesser Cover} until they move or the start of their next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Food Fight</strong>: A kobold adjacent to the table can spend 1 action to pick up a scrap of rotting meat and throw it at a hero within 20 feet. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 to hit. If the Strike hits, it doesn’t deal damage. Instead, the hero is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} until they spend an action to clean the gross food off (no check needed).</li>
<li><strong>Oil Attack</strong>: The chest between two of the sleeping alcoves contains, among other things, three jars of slippery oil. A kobold must spend an action to open the chest before they can use the oil stored inside. Once the chest is open, a kobold next to it can spend 1 action to pick up and throw one of these jars of oil. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 to hit. If it hits a hero, that hero and the square they’re in are coated in slippery oil. On a miss, the oil covers the ground but not the hero. The kobold can also throw the oil at an empty square to make just the square slippery.<br />For the rest of the fight, a hero covered in oil has trouble moving. Each time they Stride, they must attempt a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:10]{Acrobatics Skill Check}. If they fail, they fall over and gain the prone condition instead of moving. The hero can Step, moving only 5 feet, without this check.<br />Anyone who moves through a square covered in oil must attempt a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:10]{Acrobatics Skill Check}. If they fail, they stop moving and fall.</li>

<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>For overcoming the kobolds in this room, award each hero 120 XP. Note that the heroes can earn additional XP depending on how they handle the last remaining kobold.</p>
<h2>Kobold Surrender</h2>
<p>When only one kobold remains, he immediately drops his weapons and surrenders to the heroes, begging and groveling for his life with a raspy, high-pitched voice. If the heroes spare the kobold, the creature promises to leave and never return, but he also quietly adds that he's willing to share secrets in exchange for gold.</p>
<p>The heroes have two options if they want to learn what the kobold knows. The first is to offer the kobold the gold he requests. If they give the kobold 10 gp, he shares what he knows about the boss, and if they give him 20 gp (total, not in addition), he also shares what he knows about the dragon.</p>
<p>But parting with their hard-earned wealth isn't the only solution. A hero can try to persuade the kobold to share what he knows by rolling a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:10]{Diplomacy skill check}, or they can bully the kobold with an @Check[type:intimidation|dc:10]{Intimidation skill check}. If a hero's total is 10 or more, they learn about the boss, and if their total is 20 or more, they learn about the dragon, too.</p>
<p><strong>About the Boss</strong>: The kobold says the following about their warren's boss.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">"Boss Zolgran is the big leader of the mighty kobolds, and she has powerful magics to roast you alive! She's very angry all the time and demands much from her servants. Especially now that we have a powerful new friend!"</p>
<p><strong>About the Dragon</strong>: The kobold says the following about the dragon.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">"The friend is a dragon and a blessing from the gods, a sign that kobolds are destined to return to the surface and conquer the pathetic human town. As soon as the hatchling is all grown, we'll rise up to take what is ours!"</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>If the heroes get the surrendered kobold to tell them about the boss, award each hero an additional 10 XP. If they get him to tell them about the dragon, increase this bonus to 30 XP instead.</p>

<p>Once the fight ends, the heroes can examine the rest of the warren. Each kobold here is wearing a copper-and-eggshell necklace like those found in @JournalEntry[YrtJLob1PBfZmlww]{Area 12}.</p>
<p>In addition to the kobolds' gear, there's a chest filled with trinkets and collected valuables. It holds a bolt of fine silk cloth worth 5 gp, a painting of an adventurer on a horse worth 2 gp, a sack filled with 20 sp, a crystal decanter filled with old, sour wine (the decanter is worth 1 gp), 3 jars of oil (minus any the kobolds threw during the fight), a <em>ladder feather token</em>, and a <em>healing potion</em>.</p>
