<p>This chamber contains a devious trap. When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">While much of this rectangular chamber is in ruins, the center contains a fountain of pristine water with something glittering at the bottom. In the middle of the fountain is a marble statue of a mermaid, her lips pursed as if she were about to blow a kiss, or maybe whistle. Each corner of the pool has some sort of mechanism embedded in the stones, but the one in the southwest corner appears to be smashed.</p>
<p>The mermaid statue in the center of the room is the center of a devious trap. When the heroes enter the room, ask each player to roll a @Check[type:perception|dc:20]{Perception Check}. Take note of these results, because you'll also use them to determine the heroes' initiative.</p>
<p>If anyone's total is 20 or higher, they notice the trap before setting it off. If not, the heroes don't notice anything unusual. They can act normally- but if anyone steps on any of the tiles adjacent to the pool, the trap goes off!</p>

<p>This trap is complex, which means it works like a monster. If the heroes trigger the trap, use the Perception results from before to determine their initiative. You can do this by activating the combat tracker and clicking on the fist icon beside the roll in chat. The fountain rolls Stealth for its initiative.</p>
<p>On its turn, the statue in the middle of the fountain spins around, shooting a stream of high-pressure water from its mouth. The exact effects are different each round and target random parts of the room. The trap's Routine entry describes how this works.</p>
<h3>Overcoming the Trap</h3>
<p>The heroes can overcome this trap in a variety of ways. If someone notices it before it goes off and everyone avoids the squares adjacent to the fountain, they can safely bypass the trap.</p>
<p>Once the trap goes off, the heroes can try to disable the control mechanisms located at each corner of the pool. If any of these stones are still active, the trap continues to act on its turn, but fortunately for the heroes, the mechanism in the southwest corner has already been destroyed (leaving only those in the other three corners to deactivate). To deactivate a mechanism, a hero must stand in an adjacent square and spend 2 actions to attempt a @Check[type:thievery|dc:20]{Thievery Skill Check}. On a success, that mechanism is disabled.</p>
<p>The heroes can also physically destroy the three remaining mechanisms by attacking them individually (using the AC and Hit Points in the trap's stat block). The fountain, being made of stone, has Hardness. Each time a hero hits a mechanism, subtract this number from the damage roll before reducing the mechanismâ€™s Hit Points.</p>
<p>Once there are no functioning mechanisms left, whether the heroes have disabled or destroyed them, the trap stops working, and the heroes can continue their exploration.</p>

<p>Once the trap is deactivated, a hero can easily climb into the fountain and get the coins. The water is only 1 foot deep, and while it's very cold, it's not dangerous. Inside the fountain are 28 cp, 8 sp, and 2 gp.</p>
<p>Often, when players find a stash of assorted coins, they'll want to split them equally. You can use the "distribute coins" button on the loot sheet to share the currency between your heroes without needing to do any calculations yourself!</p>
