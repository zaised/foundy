<p>The adventure included in the Pathfinder Beginner Box, "Menace Under Otari," is sanctioned for use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. The rules for running this adventure and chronicle sheet are available as a free download from Paizo, at the page linked above.</p>
<p>One of the restrictions on playing the adventure Menace Under Otari in Pathfinder Society, outlined in the "Running the Adventure" section of the Beginner Box Sanctioning guide, is that characters that are used in the adventure must be built using the more streamlined rules contained within the Beginner Box. These can be the pregenerated iconic characters or new heroes of your own creation.</p>
<p>Because the PF2E system on Foundry adapts the full version of the rules, we have at times simplified our rules references so that the advice and indications in these journals are consistent with both the mechanical implementation of the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset by its Foundry development team and the rules outlined within the Beginner Box. The full variant rules that are used by Pathfinder Society for the Beginner Box are still available in your PDF.</p>
<p>Because of our changes, we have included additional guidance for those seeking to meet these requirements for Organised Play below.</p>
<h3>Playing With Pregenerated Characters</h3>
<p>The easiest option is to use pregenerated heroes, which Paizo recommends within their guidance as improving the immersion of players within the story. If you do so, please make sure that you have imported the Beginner Box version of the pregens from the "Non-iconic Pregens" compendium. These are the same character sheets which are included in the Beginner Box.</p>
<p>The iconic characters as they are presented in other Paizo products, which are contained in the "Iconics" compendium, would <em>not</em> qualify for Pathfinder Society credits.</p>
<h3>Creating Your Own Characters</h3>
<p>If you would like to make your own hero for Pathfinder Society play, we suggest consulting the rules as contained within the Beginner's Box PDF that was included with your purchase of this module to ensure that you are compliant. In addition, the Beginner Box Sanctioning guide linked above is a free document which will help you understand the full details of running this adventure in Pathfinder Society.</p>

<h3>Have Fun!</h3>
<p>Above all, we hope that, however you choose to play this adventure, you and your entire party have a wonderful time. That's why we chose to include the ability for the GM to decide which version of the adventure they want to play, and we strongly believe there is no wrong way to have fun.</p>
