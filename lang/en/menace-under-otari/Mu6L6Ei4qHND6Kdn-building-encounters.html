<p>Challenges are the big, dramatic points in your adventure. They often feature combat @JournalEntry[5vvtOkNxnpzih0bO]{Encounters} with other creatures, but they can also include @JournalEntry[TyXs3Gk0DQMSGotS]{Hazards}, or you might create social challenges in which characters duel only with words. The rules for building challenges appropriate to your group’s level begin below.</p>
<p>Some adventures have a clear and direct progression, with challenges occurring at specific times or in a specific order. Others, such as a dungeon filled with interconnected rooms the group can investigate in any order, are nonlinear, and the group can face challenges in any order—or even avoid them entirely. Most adventures are somewhere in between, with some keystone challenges you know the heroes must contend with and some optional ones that the heroes could avoid.</p>
<h1>Encounters</h1>
<p>The most common type of challenge is a combat encounter, where the heroes fight other creatures. As you plan your adventure, think about the kinds of creatures that fit your story. Not all of them have to be important to the plot. It’s okay to include monsters you think would just be fun to use! Think about your players, too. Include monsters you think they’d like going up against based on the players’ personalities.</p>
<p>While you’re picking encounters for your adventure, make notes about which area each encounter appears in and details about the creatures involved. This includes notes on their place in the adventure’s plot and any treasure you want them to carry. You can look at the rooms in “Menace under Otari” for the types of information to include, though you can just use brief notes instead of writing everything out in detail.</p>
<h3>Building Encounters</h3>
<p>To build a combat encounter, first decide how the encounter fits into the adventure as a whole. Then, estimate how much of a threat you want the encounter to pose. An encounter has an XP budget. This is how much XP all the monsters in it are worth. This budget depends on how much of a threat the foes are. A group worth less than 60 XP isn’t much of a fight, and one above 120 XP might be too deadly!</p>
<p>The @JournalEntry[4nsXBFKFLs3db33S]{Encounter Budget} handout has all of the tables you'll need in one place— use it to quickly build engaging and balanced encounters.</p>

<h3>Encounter Difficulty</h3>
<p>• <strong>Low-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 60 XP) use some of the party’s resources, but they aren’t that scary. It would be unlikely (or the result of very poor tactics) for the entire party to be seriously threatened.</p>
<p>• <strong>Moderate-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 80 XP) are a serious challenge to the heroes, though unlikely to overpower them completely. Heroes usually need to use sound tactics and manage their resources wisely.</p>
<p>•<strong>Severe-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 120 XP) are the hardest encounters most groups of heroes can consistently defeat. These encounters should be save for important moments in your story, such as confronting a final boss. Bad luck, poor tactics, or lack of resources due to prior encounters can easily turn a severe-threat encounter against the heroes, and a wise group keeps the option to disengage open.</p>
<p>You might warn the players when they enter a severe fight, especially if they’re new to Pathfinder. Their heroes likely can tell when they’re up against an enemy that looks really tough, even if the players aren’t sure yet!</p>
