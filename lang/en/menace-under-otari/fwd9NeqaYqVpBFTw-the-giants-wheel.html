<p class="box-text narrative first">An enormous waterwheel that powers the lumber equipment in the Otari Mill.</p>
<h3>Landmarks</h3>
<p>This towering waterwheel is truly a sight to behold. With a diameter of 30 feet, the immense wooden wheel generates the torque needed to power a mechanized lumber mill and turn the treadmill that transports cut logs. The Giant’s Wheel has belonged to the Menhemes family for generations, but it isn’t exclusively used by the Otari Mill. The other two lumber companies pay to use the mill, allowing Oseph to keep an eye on his competition. The constant noise of the wheel’s grinding and churning competes with the whine of the saws and the clatter of the loading ramp. At night, the busywork of the mill can be heard in the town below.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>Day-to-day operation of the Giant’s Wheel and its mill fall to its foreman, the heavily scarred ex-gladiator named Klorte Hengus. In his youth, Klorte made a name for himself as a gladiator in a distant metropolis, fighting with paired hatchets as “the Lumberjacker.” The serious Klorte considers that violent past behind him, and he fails to see any irony in the fact that he now works for actual lumberjacks.</p>
