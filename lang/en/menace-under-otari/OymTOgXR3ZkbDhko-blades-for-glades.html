<p class="box-text narrative first">Otari's primary smithy, which sells armor and weapons in addition to saws and axes.</p>
<h3>Goods and Services</h3>
<p>The primary smithy in town specializes in crafting saws, axes, and other tools used in the lumber trade, but the skilled smiths here also produce quality armor, shields, and weapons.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>The owner of Blades for Glades is a misanthropic man named Carman Rajani, who’s as happy to sell a sword to split an orc as a hatchet to fell a tree. He’s descended from one of Otari's founders and believes himself entitled to better treatment from the townspeople than his surly demeanor earns him.</p>
