<h2>Iconic Characters</h2>
<p>The Beginner Box was designed for use with the following four iconic characters, any of which would be a great choice for new players or those who want to jump straight into the action:</p>

</section>
<p>You can find them under "Heroes" on the actors tab of the sidebar on the right hand side of your screen.Â </p>
<p>To learn more about how to play the iconic characters, or to help you decide which one to play, you can read the descriptions of each class, which finishes with a summary of their backstory.</p>
<h2>Other Characters</h2>
<p>If you want to expand the choices at your table, any of the level 1 heroes from the Iconics compendium would serve well. However, some of them may feature more complicated classes or features than those included in the Beginner Box.</p>
<p>In addition, you can always make your own heroes from scratch. In that case, consult the @JournalEntry[KIpNnMtah73eyPC8]{Character Creation} journal entry. You'll need to provide your own tokens for these heroes, or choose from one of the several generic tokens included with this world. Your GM can find them inside of the module files, at:</p>
