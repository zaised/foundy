<p>Bring out the players’ curiosity through memorable settings that include mysterious and fantastical locations for the heroes to visit! Exploring each location should be a treat in itself, not just a step the players must complete to get from one fight to the next. As you create a locale, picture it in your mind’s eye, and write down details you can include as you narrate the game. Describing decorations, natural landmarks, wildlife, peculiar smells, and even temperature changes makes a place feel more real.</p>
<p>Beyond monsters and loot, your locations can include challenges based on the environment, from weather conditions like blizzards to puzzles, traps, or other hazards. These challenges should suit your adventure’s location: walls of brambles in a castle ruin overrun with vegetation, pools of acid in a cursed swamp, or magical traps in the tomb of a paranoid wizard. Consult the handouts for @JournalEntry[oiCmDc80T3El2rDj]{Environments}, @JournalEntry[RfiFMieaKMI9mGw2]{Weather}, and @JournalEntry[TyXs3Gk0DQMSGotS]{Hazards} for inspiration.</p>
<h1>Drawing a Map</h1>
<p>Most adventures focus on a single location or dungeon. Once you know your adventure's story, you can start drawing the map to make it easier to keep track of where everything is. It's best to draw the map on a sheet of graph paper first, with each square on the graph paper representing a 5-foot square. Then, when you run the game, you can use a map with a 1-inch grid (where every square inch represents a 5-foot square).</p>
<p>When you first draw your map, you should use a pencil so you can make changes easily. You can also jot down notes for each room as they come to you, like "guard post" or "spider nest."</p>
<h3>Sample Map</h3>
<p>Here you can see the sketch used to make the first level of the "Menace under Otari" map! Below it is a set of symbols you can use to represent common features found in most dungeons: doors, stairs, traps, pillars, and more.</p>

<h2>Mapping Tips</h2>
<p>• <strong>Avoid Empty Rooms</strong>: Don’t add too many empty rooms, as they can clutter your map and get boring and repetitive quickly.</p>
<p>• <strong>Leave Room for Expansion</strong>: Unless you’re certain you don’t want to return to your dungeon, allow for places to expand later for future adventures. A tunnel running off the edge of the map, a flight of stairs leading down, or a large pit can all lead the way to new areas.</p>
<p>• <strong>Avoid Symmetry</strong>: Refrain from creating symmetrical dungeons in which one half is an exact mirror image of the other— it's unrealistic, and the players might be disappointed when they realize that they only have to explore half of a dungeon to see it all.</p>
<p>• <strong>Vary Room Shapes</strong>: Instead of just a bunch of rectangles, include strangely shaped rooms, alcoves, multilevel rooms, irregular caverns, and other variations. You can look at maps of real-world locations to get some ideas.</p>
<p>• <strong>Use Wide Corridors</strong>: Remember that combat in Pathfinder is based on 5-foot squares. If you fill your dungeon with 5-foot-wide hallways, you might end up with combats in which some of the heroes or monsters can’t actually get into the fight!</p>
<p>• <strong>Don't Make a Maze</strong>: Avoid the temptation to make your map into a maze- exploring one gets old quick once you're playing, especially if you spend most of your time during the game drawing twisted corridors on your mat when you could be running combat!</p>
<h2>Finishing the Map</h2>
<p>Once you're happy with your map, inking in the pencil lines makes the map a lot easier to read. You can use a fat-tipped pen to draw solid walls. Thinner pens are great for drawing doors and map symbols. Adding color (whether with pens or colored pencils) makes your map even easier to read. <span style="font-family:var(--journal-serif);font-size:var(--font-size-14)">Number each room so you can easily refer to it in your notes. If possible, use a pen of a different color from anything else on your map so the number tags are easy to see.</span></p>
<p>If you have a computer and scanner, you can scan your map and then use an image-editing program to refine it. This is handy if you make an error on the map with ink and need to fix things. Details such as furniture, fire pits, pillars, and so on add a touch of realism to inhabited dungeons, but you can also add these when you draw it on a battle grid if you feel comfortable doing so on the fly.</p>
<p>Once you've finished your map, you can upload it to your VTT of choice and add walls, lights, or tokens as you see fit. Even a hand-drawn map can work perfectly well in a digital environment- just be sure to supplement it with descriptions of the rooms to breathe some life into your creation! </p>
<h2>Strange Rooms</h2>
<p>If you’re having a hard time coming up with ideas for your map, you can take ideas from “Menace under Otari,” or use some of these classic ideas.</p>
<p>• Monster barracks full of filthy straw nests.</p>
<p>• Narrow ledge overlooking a chasm.</p>
<p>• Natural chimney in the rock that the heroes can climb up to reach a higher level.</p>
<p>• Ancient library covered in dust.</p>
<p>• Long hallway with rows of statues or suits of armor.</p>
<p>• Sewer chamber blocked by gates on each side, with the levers to open them in another room.</p>
<p>• Feasting hall with a large fire pit in the center.</p>
<p>• Pens where guard animals are kept.</p>
<p>• Museum with art made of permanent illusions.</p>
<p>• Don't forget the latrines!</p>
