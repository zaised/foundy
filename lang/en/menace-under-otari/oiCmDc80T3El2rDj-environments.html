<p>Environment rules bring the locales your party travels through to life. You can often just use common sense as you run the game in different environments, but you need special rules for ones that really stand out. The entries below provide rules for special types of terrain, plus a few suggestions of sensory details you can add in as the heroes explore that environment. Many places have elements from multiple environments—for example, a snow-covered mountain might use both the arctic and mountain environment rules. The DCs here are typical ones provided for convenience. You can change the DCs as needed, using the normal rules for setting @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Difficulty Classes}, and you can always choose to use just the environment rules that work best for your game.</p>
<p>Many adventures take place in dungeons—underground strongholds, warrens, or crypts that have become the dens of dangerous creatures. A dungeon could be constructed or naturally occurring, but either way, it combines the features of underground and urban environments found below. Regardless, your adventure can be set anywhere!</p>

<h3>Aquatic</h3>
<p>Aquatic environments are among the most challenging for heroes, short of other worlds and unusual dimensions.</p>
<p>• Swimming: Athletics skill to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swim}(DC 10 for still water, 15 for flowing water, and 20 for swiftly flowing water).</p>
<p>• Currents: Ocean currents, flowing rivers, and similar moving water are difficult terrain for a creature swimming against the current (see Difficult Terrain in @JournalEntry[qD5sw1wEN0D9EYRp]{Movement}). If a creature’s in a current at the end of its turn, it moves a certain distance depending on the speed of the current (usually 5 feet or 10 feet). For instance, a 10-foot current moves a creature 10 feet in the current’s direction at the end of that creature’s turn.</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> choppy water, rolling waves, sunlight glinting, the curve of the horizon, driftwood</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> waves lapping against a ship, seabirds' cries, fluttering sails, creatures breaching the surface</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> salt water, crisp fresh air, dead fish</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> frigid water, slimy seaweed, crusty salt collecting on surfaces</p>
</article>
<article class="full">
<h3>Arctic</h3>
<p>The main challenge in an arctic environment is the low temperature, as described in the @JournalEntry[RfiFMieaKMI9mGw2]{Weather} journal, but arctic environments also contain ice and snow.</p>
<p>• Ice: Acrobatics skill to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} without falling down (DC 12).</p>
<p>• Snow: Difficult terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> blinding reflected sunlight, snowy plains, distant glaciers, deep crevasses, rocky cliffs, ice floes and bergs, animal tracks in snow</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> howling winds, drips of melting ice, utter quiet</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> clean air, half-frozen bog, lichen, seaweed</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> crunching snow, hard ice</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> frigid gales, light snowfall, pounding blizzard</p>
</article>
<article class="full">
<h3>Desert</h3>
<p>Desert encompasses both sandy and rocky deserts as well as rugged badlands.</p>
<p>• Rubble: Rocky deserts are strewn with rubble, which is difficult terrain (see Difficult Terrain in @JournalEntry[qD5sw1wEN0D9EYRp]{Movement}). Rubble dense enough to be walked over rather than navigated through requires Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance}as well (DC 15).</p>
<p>• Sand: Packed sand doesn’t impede movement, but loose sand is difficult terrain. Especially deep or loose sand requires a creature crossing it to use Acrobatics to Balance (DC 20).</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> blinding reflected sunlight, rolling dunes, a mirage, circling vultures</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling winds, cascading sand, insects at night</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> dust, desert herbs</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> coarse sand, warm rock, dry brush</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> direct heat, dust devil, sandstorm</p>
</article>
<article class="full">
<h3>Forest</h3>
<p>These environments include jungles and other wooded areas.</p>
<p>• Trees: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a tree (DC 15). Trees that take up an entire 5-foot square on the map (or more) are big enough to provide standard cover; narrower trees don’t.</p>
<p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Heavy undergrowth gives standard cover to anyone in it, but it’s even harder to move through. Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement, not just 5!</p>
<p>• Vines: Acrobatics or Athletics skill to swing on a vine (DC 15).</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> towering trees, dense undergrowth, verdant canopies, colorful wildlife, dappled sunlight through the trees, mossy tree trunks, twisted roots</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling leaves, snapping branches, animal calls</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> decomposing vegetation, flowering plants, pine trees, earthy mushrooms</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> leaves crunching underfoot, scraping branches, water dripping from above, rough bark</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> still air, cool shade, sporadic breeze, rain on the canopy, branches coated in thick snow</p>
</article>
<article class="full">
<h3>Mountain</h3>
<p>Mountain environments also include hills, which share many aspects of mountains, though not their more extreme features.</p>
<p>• Chasms: Athletics to make a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump} across a chasm or similar natural pit (DC 15 for a chasm 10 feet across; add 5 to the DC for every 5 feet wider). Failing to make the jump means taking bludgeoning damage from the fall equal to half the distance fallen. Alternatively, creatures can take the safer but slower route of Climbing down the near side of the chasm and then ascending the far side to get across. Good depths for chasms are 30 feet or 50 feet. Much deeper, and the fall is likely to kill a hero!</p>
<p>• Cliffs and Slopes: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a cliff (DC 10 for sloped cliffs, 15 for steep cliffs, or 20 for sheer cliffs or steep ones with few handholds). Without extensive safety precautions, such as having a creature farther up secure a rope, a critical failure can result in significant falling damage.</p>
<p>• Lava: A volcano might have small lava flows. Just the heat from being near lava is harmful, dealing 1d6 fire damage each round to anyone within 10 feet. Going into the lava is almost certain death for anyone not immune to fire. It deals 20d6 fire damage every round!</p>
<p>• Rubble and Scree: Difficult terrain. Especially deep or pervasive rubble requires Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} as well (DC 15).</p>
<p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Thick undergrowth on mountains is rare and follows the rules found under forests.</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> bare cliffs, snow caps, hardy trees, slopes littered with scree, fallen rocks, birds flying on currents, fog among the peaks</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> howling wind, falling rocks, clear echoes, crunch of rocks underfoot, distant avalanche</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> blowing dust, pine trees, fresh snow</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> rough stone, powdery snow, unstable rubble</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> swirling clouds, chill of high altitude, direct sunlight, powerful wind and rain</p>
</article>
<article class="full">
<h3>Plains</h3>
<p>The plains environment encompasses grasslands, such as savannas and farmland. Such terrain is usually fairly flat and easy to traverse.</p>
<p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Thick undergrowth in plains is rare (usually planted hedges or tall crops like corn) and follows the rules found under forests.</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> grass waving gently, scattered wildflowers, rocky outcroppings or boulders, the curve of the horizon</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling wind, birdsong, distant sounds carried far</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> fresh air, earthy soil, distant carcasses</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> touch of tall grass, rasp of scrub brush, crunch of dry dirt</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> cooling of gentle wind, heat of direct sunlight, massive black thunderclouds</p>
</article>
<article class="full">
<h3>Swamp</h3>
<p>Wetlands are the most common kind of swamp, but this category also includes drier marshes such as moors.</p>
<p>• Bogs: Shallow bogs are difficult terrain for Medium creatures. Squares in deep bogs cost Medium creatures 10 extra feet of Speed per square, not just 5! If a bog is deep enough that a creature can’t reach the bottom, the creature has to use Athletics to Swim (DC 12).</p>
<p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Heavy undergrowth gives standard cover to anyone in it, but it’s even harder to move through. Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement, not just 5!</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> lush leaves, clouds of gnats, algae-coated water, shacks on stilts, darting fish</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> croaking frogs, chirping insects, bubbling waters, splashing</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> rich moss and algae, pungent swamp gases</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> pushing through floating detritus, tangling creepers, thick mud</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> oppressive humidity, still air, pouring rain, rays of sunlight</p>

<h3>Underground</h3>
<p>Most underground environments consist of caves and other natural formations. Artificial dungeons and ruins combine underground features with urban features, like stairs and walls. Deep underground vaults have some of the same terrain features as mountains, such as chasms and cliffs.</p>
<p>• Cliffs and Slopes: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a cliff (DC 10 for sloped cliffs, 15 for steep cliffs, or 20 for sheer cliffs or steep ones with few handholds). Without safety precautions like a creature farther up securing a rope, a critical failure can result in significant falling damage (bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen).</p>
<p>• Floors: Natural cavern floors are rarely flat. They tend to have abrupt changes in elevation that are difficult terrain or require using Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} (DC 10 or 12).</p>
<p>• Ledges: Moving across a narrow ledge requires using Acrobatics to Balance (DC 12).</p>
<p>• Magma: Caverns deep underground might have magma flowing within. Just the heat from being near magma is harmful, causing 1d6 fire damage each round to anyone within 10 feet. Going into the magma is almost certain death for anyone not immune to fire. It deals 20d6 fire damage every round!</p>
<p>• Rubble: Difficult terrain. Especially deep or pervasive rubble requires Acrobatics to Balance on when crossing it as well (DC 17).</p>
<p>• Walls: Athletics to Climb a natural cave wall (DC 20). Since most caves are formed by water, cave walls are often damp, making the DC 22 or 25.</p>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> winding passages, sputtering yellow torchlight, uneven or cracked floors, ancient writings or architecture, stalagmites and stalactites</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> dripping condensation, scurrying rats or insects, distant clunks of machinery, tinny echoes of your voices and footsteps</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> staleness of still air, sulfur, tang of metal deposits</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> rough rock walls, stone smoothed by erosion, cobwebs</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> chill of underground air, geothermal heat</p>

<h3>Urban</h3>
<p>Urban environments include open city spaces as well as buildings. The building information in this section also applies to ruins and constructed dungeons.</p>
<p>• Crowds: Crowded thoroughfares and similar areas are difficult terrain. You might allow a creature to persuade a crowd to part and allow it to pass using Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance.</p>
<p>A crowd exposed to an obvious danger, like a fire or a rampaging monster, attempts to move away from the danger as quickly as possible, but a crowd is slowed by its own mass. A fleeing crowd typically moves at a Speed of 25 feet, potentially trampling or leaving behind slower-moving members of the crowd.</p>
<p>• Doors: Opening a door takes an Interact action. Locked doors require a creature to use Thievery to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H]{Pick a Lock}. The DC and number of successes required to open the lock depend on the quality of the lock. Remember that a critical success is worth two successes!</p>
<p>• Rooftops: Flat roofs are easy to move across. Angled roofs require creatures to use Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} (DC 13) or, if they’re especially steep, Athletics to Climb (DC 13).</p>
<p>Hurtling from roof to roof often requires using Athletics for a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump}, though some buildings are close enough to Leap between. A High Jump might be necessary to reach a higher roof.</p>
<p>• Sewers: Sewers are generally 10 feet or more below street level and are equipped with ladders or other means to ascend and descend. Raised paths along the walls allow sewer workers access, while channels in the center carry waste. Sewers grates require 2 or more Interact actions to open, though they might be locked using the rules for locked doors above.</p>
<p>• Stairs: Difficult terrain for creatures moving up them, normal for creatures moving down.</p>
<p>• Walls: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} (DC 18 for a constructed stone wall, DC 20 for a brick wall).</p>
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> milling crowds, domesticated animals, multi-story buildings, trash blowing in the streets</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> town criers, shouting children, rattling wagon wheels</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> freshly baked bread, chimney smoke, industrial fumes, perfume, sewage</p>
<p><strong>Textures:</strong> smooth cobblestones</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> rain on the rooftops</p>
<h3>In Otari</h3>
<p>These details are especially pronounced in @JournalEntry[NNmKsnjJOZogP2fO]{Otari}.</p>
<p><strong>Sights:</strong> docked boats laden with fish, lumber sliding down the road toward the dock</p>
<p><strong>Smells:</strong> caught fish, freshly cut lumber</p>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> sawmill blades whirring</p>
