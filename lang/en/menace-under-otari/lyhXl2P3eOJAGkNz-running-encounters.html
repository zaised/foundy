<p><span style="font-family:var(--journal-serif);font-size:var(--font-size-14)">Once you've finished @JournalEntry[Mu6L6Ei4qHND6Kdn]{building an encounter}, you need to get ready to run it! </span>In encounters, you should keep track of every action the heroes and monsters use while they fight. You start an encounter with a roll for initiative, as mentioned above.</p>
<h2>Choosing Monster Actions</h2>
<p>As the GM, you roleplay monsters and choose their tactics. Players often coordinate and plan to be as efficient as possible, but monsters might not! Most creatures have a basic grasp of simple tactics like flanking or focusing on a single target. But remember that they also react based on emotions and make mistakes! Some creatures have only animal intelligence or are mindless, and you should play them that way.</p>
<p>Monsters usually don’t attack a hero who’s knocked out. Even if a creature knows a fallen hero might come back into the fight, only the most vicious creatures focus on helpless foes rather than the more immediate threats around them.</p>
<h2>Ending Encounters</h2>
<p>An encounter typically ends when all the creatures on one side are killed or knocked unconscious. Once this happens, you can stop acting in initiative order—unless any heroes are dying or in some other situation where every moment matters for their survival.</p>
<p>Surrender: One side might surrender when almost all its members are defeated or if spells or skills thoroughly demoralize them. Once there’s a surrender, come out of initiative order and have the heroes enter into a short negotiation to see whether the winners show mercy.</p>
<p>Escape: Having enemies flee can cause problems. Heroes often want to pursue foes that flee because they think an enemy might return as a threat later on. If you run this round-by-round, your game will get boring quickly! Instead, ask anyone who wants to pursue their fleeing enemy how they pursue. If they use an ability or spell that seems really helpful, and if their Speed isn’t much slower than the escaping enemy, they catch the enemy. If not, the enemy escapes for now unless it’s much slower than the heroes.</p>
<p>If the heroes decide to flee, it’s usually best to let them do so. Pick a particular location on the map and allow them to escape once they all reach it.</p>
<h2>Bypassed Encounters</h2>
<p>What happens if you plan a fight or challenge and the heroes find a way to avoid it entirely? This could leave them behind on XP or cause them to miss important information or treasure.</p>
<p>In the case of XP, the guidelines are simple: If the heroes avoided the challenge with smart thinking and planning, award them the normal XP they would have received! If they did something that was more of a lucky break, like finding a secret passage past the fight, instead award them XP for a minor or moderate accomplishment.</p>
<p>If information or items get skipped, look for another reasonable place elsewhere in the adventure to place the information or item. If it makes sense, move the original encounter to another part of the adventure and give the heroes a major advantage when they reach that encounter since they bypassed the original encounter.</p>
<h2>Social Interactions</h2>
<p>Some conversations and other social interactions are important enough that you should treat them with the same importance as encounters. If major consequences can come from the conversation, success or failure really matters. These interactions should be worth XP. It’s usually a moderate accomplishment, but it might be a major one for something like talking a king out of going to war!</p>
<p>Social interactions don’t follow the same rules as combat. Roleplay them as a conversation, and have the heroes roll skill checks as appropriate. These are usually Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation, but players might think of something clever, like using Religion to make friends with a local priest. Remember that you can give heroes circumstance bonuses (usually +1 or +2) if their approach is really likely to work on the person they’re talking to.</p>
