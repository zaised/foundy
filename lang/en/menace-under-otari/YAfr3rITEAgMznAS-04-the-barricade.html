<p>This intersection presents the heroes with a choice of which direction to go, and it includes a skill challenge that can affect their encounters further within the dungeon.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">After the web-infested cave, the passageway leading deeper underneath the streets of Otari appears to be mostly natural, but someone, or something, has worked to open the cavern and level out the floor, making the passage easily traveled. A crude barricade made from old wooden planks and part of a barrel blocks the entrance to a side tunnel, while the main passage continues off into the gloom.</p>
<p>If any hero examines the barricade, ask them to attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:15]{Perception Check}. On a success, they hear a faint clattering noise coming from somewhere beyond the barricade. The area is totally unlit, but characters with a torch or darkvision can tell that the tunnel opens up into a larger room ahead, with a large rectangular object in the middle.</p>
<p>There are two ways the heroes can take apart the barricade. They can easily destroy the barrier with their weapons, but this makes a great deal of noise and alerts the monsters in Area 5 of the heroes’ approach.</p>
<p>They can also try to take the barricade apart quietly by rolling a @Check[type:crafting|dc:15]{Crafting Skill Check} or @Check[type:thievery|dc:15]{Thievery Skill Check}. Their effort removes the barricade whether they succeed or fail, but if they fail, they make enough noise to alert the enemies in @JournalEntry[SVdFYwhRpCvTwIwN]{Area 05}. If they succeed, they avoid alerting the monsters.</p>
<p>If you're using the Enhanced maps, there might be additional tools you can use to make this moment as smooth as possible. Make sure to read the informational box below to find out more!</p>

<h2>Doors</h2>

<p>Here, the players are faced with an obstacle which inhibits movement and vision further down the tunnel to the north. You might notice a door icon on the map over the barricade- that's because this barricade is a door!</p>
<h3>Doors in Foundry</h3>
<p>In Foundry VTT, doors are simply a type of wall that can be opened by players or GMs that click on the icon. They can have the same traits as other types of walls- they block any combination of light, sound, vision, and movement, or none of them. Doors also have some extra options that normal walls can't- you can lock doors so that players can't open them, or even hide their icon from players to make "secret" doors that only the GM can open. To see these settings for yourself, you can navigate to the walls layer on your toolbar (the temple icon), and then double right-click on any wall node.</p>
<h3>Clearing the Barricade</h3>
<p>In this case, this wall is already preconfigured for you. It's "secret", which means it can only be seen or opened by the GM, and it blocks both movement and vision. Players will need to succeed a skill check to clear the barricade, at which point you simply need to remove it to let them pass. On the original maps, you can do this by simply clicking on the door icon.</p>
<p>If you're using our enhanced map, you also have the option of going a little further. We've included a tile on the scene that can be swapped out when the barricade is dismantled. We've even provided a macro to do it for you! When run, it plays a sound effect, determined by whether your party dismantled the barricade noisily or quietly. Then, after a short delay, it swaps out the tile and opens the door at the same time.</p>
<p>To use the macro, you need only click here @Macro[saQTdI63wy22v5yk]{Area 04 - Barricade} and begin narrating how your players bypass the obstacle as the sounds play in the background.</p>
<h3>Other Doors In This Adventure</h3>
<p>There's a locked door in @JournalEntry[qV9wXKf17pbA7e61]{Area 07}, and there are similar obstacles to the barricade in @JournalEntry[YrtJLob1PBfZmlww]{Area 12} and @JournalEntry[IUExNAepG68GUUhS]{Area 15} which both have macros provided as well.</p>
