<p>When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">On the far side of the puddle of water is a strange chamber, crackling with magical energy. Pulsing orbs float in three of the four corners of this room. The orb in the southwest is made of brown earth and stone, whereas the one in the northeast looks to be made of glass, and is filled with a swirling cloud. The orb in the far corner holds a roaring flame; opposite that orb are shattered remains and the water that flows down the passageway to the northwest.</p>
<p>While the heroes might want to learn more about this room, they must first deal with the creature trapped here: an elemental made of pure fire that emerges from the fire orb as soon as the heroes enter.</p>

<h3>Audio Cue</h3>
<p>Once the encounter has started, the Soundboard Loops track "Everything is Fire" should be useful in indicating to your players the danger of being close to the Cinder Rat.</p>
</aside>
<p>The magic in this room summoned a small elemental creature that looks just like a rat, made up entirely of burning coal and smoldering flame. It can't go into the water, so it's trapped here and spends most of its time hiding within the fire orb. As soon as the first character passes through the water into this room, the fiery orb shatters and the cinder rat attacks. </p>
<p>To start the encounter, you can use the @Macro[iPvtf4ZGr6qX8OnF]{Area 14- Cinder Rat} macro. It will replace the orb on the map with a broken one, and play a sound effect, while also revealing the cinder rat's token. All you need to do is roll for initiative!</p>

<h2>Encounter</h2>

<h3>Smoke and Concealed Creatures</h3>
<p>The cinder rat emits a cloud of smoke around itself, as described in the Fetid Fumes ability. This gives it the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition, making it hard to hit with attacks. Whenever a hero attempts a spell attack roll or Strikes the rat, first ask the player to roll a flat check—a d20 roll with nothing added. If the die comes up with a 5 or higher, the hero can attack normally. If the roll is a 4 or less, the attack misses.</p>
<p>The smoke also chokes nearby creatures, forcing them to make fortitude saves to avoid choking.</p>
<h3>Persistent Damage</h3>
<p>Whenever the cinder rat hits a hero, that hero catches on fire! This deals persistent damage, a special type of damage that doesn’t happen right away. Instead, that hero takes [[/r 1d4 #persistent fire]]{1d4 persistent fire damage} at the end of their turn (not the rat’s turn). The hero can then attempt a flat check (roll a d20 without adding anything) to see if the fire goes out—if the result is a 15 or higher, the flames are extinguished! If not, they’ll take the damage again at the end of their next turn (rolling 1d4 each time they take this damage), and then roll a new flat check. This happens at the end of every turn until the fire goes out.</p>
<p>There are other actions a hero can use to put out the fire. A hero can spend an action to pat out the flames. If they do, they can roll a flat check right away, before they take the damage, as described above. A hero might also think to go jump in the puddle of water. If they drop to the ground in a square filled with water (gaining the prone condition), the flames go out automatically.</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>If the heroes encounter and defeat the cinder rat, award each hero 80 XP.</p>

<h2>Elemental Aid</h2>
<p>After the fight with the rat, the heroes can investigate the other two orbs. Both are intact and appear to be relatively stable. If anyone casts detect magic in this chamber, they sense the presence of magic.</p>
<p>The air orb is filled with a swirling cloud. If anyone touches it, a rush of wind fills the room, carrying a voice like a whisper. It says, “Call upon the wind to gain my blessing and soar through the sky.” This gives the heroes a special ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. By spending 1 action to call upon the wind, that hero can fly for their next action, moving up to 40 feet. They have to end the movement on solid ground—if they don’t, they fall and take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance they fell.</p>
<p>If the heroes touch the earth orb, they hear grinding and grumbling, like boulders falling down a hill. In this cacophony, they hear another voice that says, "Call upon the earth to gain its strength." The heroes gain a second ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. If a hero spends an action to call upon the earth, all their melee Strikes deal 2 extra damage from a sudden surge of strength. This bonus lasts until the start of the hero's next turn.</p>
<p>The orb's magical effects happen only once. If the players come back here again, the orbs are silent and don't offer any benefits.</p>
