<p>This chamber holds more of the scaly lizard-people called kobolds, plus a pair of deadly traps. When the heroes enter this room, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">The door opens with a creak, revealing a massive chamber that looks like an audience hall. On the far side, a broad set of stairs leads up to where a throne might once have been. Pillars support the high ceiling, and the ruined tatters of once decorative banners still hang from them. A decorative tile pattern centered in the middle of the room shows through the grim coating the floor.</p>
<h3>Deadly Traps</h3>
<p>This encounter includes two different kinds of traps that might attack the characters—or the kobolds! The first time a hero moves next to a trapped area, have them roll a Perception check. If their total is higher than the DC in the Notice entry for that trap, the hero notices the trap and can avoid that area.</p>
<p>If they know the trap’s location, a hero next to a trapped area can spend 2 actions to roll a Thievery check to disable that hazard. The DC of this check is listed in the trap’s Disable entry. Remember, if they critically fail, the trap goes off!</p>

<h2>Encounter</h2>
<p>@Actor[4Axci50gPQArPg7d]{Kobold Trapmaster} @Actor[r9w1n85mp9Ip4QiS]{Kobold Warriors (2)} @Actor[j8qD2LVDSP2lhLUO]{Central Spears} </p>

<article>
<h3>Central Spears</h3>
<p>The first trap in this chamber is the central spears trap. This trap is active only if the heroes set the lever in @JournalEntry[TyMgkHbcaFJD27C7]{Area 10} to “active.” Otherwise, it has no effect.</p>
<p>This trap affects part of the floor in this chamber. If the trap is active, the first creature to step on a floor tile in the white-outlined area triggers the trap—and it’s most likely the kobolds, who don’t realize the heroes have activated the trap! The trap shoots spears from the western wall, making a ranged Strike against the first creature in each row. Unlike the earlier trap, this trap has a Reset entry—if it’s not disabled, it resets after 1 minute and fires again the next time a creature moves in the outlined area.</p>
<h3>Kobold Snares</h3>
<p>The kobold trapmaster also has traps of her own- snares which she can set up as mobile traps. She sets them on the three squares located at the top of the stairs just to the east of the outlined area. You can use the @Actor[X1ZVzivrcAqbNDq2]{Spike Trap} actor to mark where they were placed. Once set up, these snares can be disarmed, but they can’t be reused—once they go off, they’re no longer a threat.</p>
<h3>Kobold Tactics</h3>
<p>Two kobold warriors are stationed here, along with a kobold trapmaster. All three kobolds have orders to make sure that no one reaches the kobold lair below.</p>
<p>The kobolds hear the door creak as it opens, so as soon as the heroes enter the room, the kobolds are ready to fight. Roll initiative (using Perception) for the kobold warriors and the trapmaster separately.</p>
<p>The two warriors start the combat at either side of the spiral staircase leading down, but they move to block the stairs at the start of their first turn. If the heroes activated the central spears trap using the control mechanism in Area 10, the kobolds set off that trap the moment they move into the outlined area to block the stairs. See Central Spears above for more information.</p>
<p>The kobold trapmaster stays where she is, spending all of her actions to lay down small spike traps. If she puts down all three of her spike traps, she then uses her spears to attack the heroes from afar until they approach.</p>

<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>For overcoming the kobolds and the hazards in this room, give each hero 136 XP.</p>
<h2>Strange Jewelry</h2>
<p>After defeating the kobolds, the players can examine their fallen foes. The kobolds’ gear is listed in their stat blocks.</p>
<p>The kobold trapmaster is wearing a special necklace: a simple copper chain and a cracked piece of a large eggshell. The shell is ivory in color, but it has strange green veins running through it. This piece is only about 3 inches across, but the egg it came from must have been at least 2 feet wide. Even if the heroes take this piece back to town, no one can identify what sort of creature would lay such a massive egg, although Tamily speculates that it might have come from a giant turtle or another reptile. The heroes have the chance to learn more about this strange egg later in the dungeon.</p>
<h2>Going Down?</h2>
<p>After defeating the kobolds, the heroes can take their belongings (noted in each creature’s stat block). The heroes won’t find other treasure in the room, but there’s another exit: the spiral staircase in the back of the room descends even deeper into the earth.</p>
<p>This is a great time for the heroes to rest and regain their spells and Hit Points before pressing onward. You should remind them of this option and encourage them to head back up to Otari to report what they discovered. They can also use this time to sell any treasure they’ve found and purchase additional gear.</p>
<p>If the heroes report to Tamily Tanderveil about the scaly creatures creeping around the caverns, she’s shaken by the story of what they found underneath her fishery, and she implores the heroes to press on to put an end to this menace. She can identify the creatures as kobolds, small reptilian humanoids related to dragons who live in small tribes and have a fondness for traps. She also notes the amount of fish that has gone missing is far greater than what could have been eaten by a handful of kobolds. Tamily is worried that there’s something far hungrier beneath the city, and she shares her concern with the heroes.</p>
<p>If the players have had a particularly hard time with the adventure thus far, you can also use this opportunity to give them a bit of help. Tamily has a pair of @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.2RuepCemJhrpKKao]{Potions of Healing} stored away in case of emergency. A hero who drinks one of these potions immediately regains 1d8 Hit Points. Tamily gladly gives both potions to the heroes if they agree to continue their exploration.</p>
