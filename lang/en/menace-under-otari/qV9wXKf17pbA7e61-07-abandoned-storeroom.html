<p>As your players approach this room, some of them might notice the faint sounds of the Kobolds trying to break into the cage. Foundry VTT's sound engine allows placed sound files to grow louder as tokens grow closer to them. When the kobolds notice the players, you can turn this sound off by switching to the Sounds layer of the scene and right-clicking the sound effect positioned on top of the kobolds.</p>

<p>This room has a small group of kobolds, small reptilian humanoids. Read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">This large room looks like it was once a storeroom for a building above. At the far side, you can make out what might have been a cage or cell at some point, but it is now full of crates and barrels. Four lizardlike creatures the size of human children are clustered around the door to the cell, trying to pry it open.</p>
<p>These kobolds are so busy trying to open the cell that they don’t notice the heroes enter, but the moment someone moves within 10 feet of any of the kobolds, they turn around, snarl, and attack— have everyone roll for initiative!</p>

<h2>Encounter</h2>

<h3>Flanking</h3>
<p>The kobolds here are cunning foes, using tactics and special abilities to gain an edge. When moving, the kobolds try to flank the heroes, standing on opposite sides of a single hero. A hero who is flanked has the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} condition (giving it a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) to all attacks made by the flanking kobolds.</p>
<p>You should see this being taken into account by the system if you look at the AC comparisons in the attack result cards!</p>
<p>The kobolds have a special ability called sneak attack that lets them deal extra damage against flat-footed heroes. A hero can stop being flanked on their turn by moving away from the kobolds, or if one of the kobolds is reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>For defeating the kobolds, award each hero 80 XP.</p>

<h2>Locked Storage</h2>

<p>After the fight, the heroes can examine their foes. Some of the kobolds are carrying dried fish stolen from the fishery—clearly they were involved in the thefts, but more fish are missing than can be explained by four kobolds.</p>
<p>The treasure in this room is in the locked steel cell. The heroes can open this cell in either of two ways. They can use a set of thieves’ tools to roll a @Check[type:thievery|dc:15]{Thievery Skill Check} to pick the lock- it opens on a success! You can right-click the door to unlock it and allow your players to open it. Alternatively, they can force open the door, which requires a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:25]{Athletics Skill Check}.</p>
<p>Inside the cell is a pile of old crates and a few barrels. While most of these contain long-spoiled food and stained cloth, one of them contains a small pile of treasure: 200 sp, a gold ring worth 5 gp, and a beautiful <em>+1 shortsword</em>—a magic weapon! The hero using this weapon increases their bonus to attack rolls by 1!</p>
