<p>Are you ready to dive into adventure? The first thing you need to do is create your hero! It's up to you to imagine your hero';s past experiences, personality, and worldview- this will set the stage for your roleplay during the game.</p>

<h3>Character Sheets</h3>
<p>The first step is getting your hands on your character sheet. If you're making new characters, your GM can create new sheets for you by clicking "Create Actor" on the actors tab of the sidebar. They'll need to assign the actor to you as well, which can be done by right-clicking on it and giving you the "Owner" permission under "Configure Permissions".</p>
<p>If you could use some guidance on learning to read and use the Pathfinder Second Edition system's character sheets, you can use the system's wiki linked above to familiarise yourself with the fields and tabs it has to offer, as well as some specific advice for playing certain classes.</p>
<h3>Useful Tools</h3>
<p>During character creation, or later on as you level up your hero, you're going to be adding actions, feats, items, spells, and other features to your character sheet. The system includes all of this data for you- you need only apply it to your character!</p>
<p>On the "compendiums" tab of your sidebar, at the bottom, there is a button labelled "Compendium Browser". When clicked, this opens an interface which allows you to search and filter through all of the rules content included in the system. You can use this to quickly find the features you'd like to choose, and then drag them from this window onto your character sheet. It's as simple as that!</p>
<h3>Character Creation Rules</h3>
<p>This handout provides a step-by-step guide for creating your Pathfinder hero, but it doesn't go into detail on numbers or rules. It's up to each individual table whether they would like to use the streamlined rules outlined into the Beginner Box, or the full rules as available in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook. If you aren't sure where you should be looking, make sure that you ask your GM. Once you have the rules in hand, you can use the steps here to guide your process!</p>
<h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>
<p>If you're planning on running the adventure Menace Under Otari for Pathfinder Society organised play, it becomes especially important that you take into account which version of the rules you use to create your characters. If you haven't already, consult the @JournalEntry[x76hH0AqjPcVnEKQ]{Pathfinder Society} journal to find out more.</p>

<p>The steps of character creation are presented in a suggested order, guiding you through the early stages of your hero’s life story, but you can complete them in whatever order you prefer. For instance, you might know you want to play a wizard before you decide that wizard will be an elf. At the very end of character creation, you’ll calculate your statistics. Many steps of character creation ask you to make choices about your ability modifiers. These statistics are essential to your character and are explained in detail in step 7.</p>
<p>Each step instructs you to fill out fields on your character sheet. The character sheet is designed to be easy to use when you’re actually playing the game, but creating a hero happens in a different order, so you’ll move back and forth through the character sheet as you go through the character creation process. Additionally, the character sheet includes every field you might need, even though not all heroes will have something to put in each field. If a field on your character sheet is not applicable to your hero, just leave that field blank.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Concept</h3>
<p>What sort of hero do you want to play? The answer to this question might be as simple as “a brave warrior,” or as complicated as “the child of elven wanderers, but raised in a city dominated by humans and devoted to Sarenrae, goddess of the sun.”</p>
<p>Consider your hero’s personality, write out a few details about their past, and think about why they adventure.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Ability Scores</h3>
<p>Before you dive into making choices, you need to familiarise yourself with @JournalEntry[mrmEfL8tRhGltGJX]{Ability Scores}. Ability modifiers affect nearly everything your character does, and  so this is a good time to identify which abilities will be most important to your hero.</p>
<p>For now, they start at 10, which gives them am modifier of +0, but they will be increased as you progress throughout the steps of this handout. You should keep track of them on your character sheet as you go.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Select an Ancestry</h3>
<p>Is your hero a sturdy dwarf, a graceful elf, or a versatile human?</p>
<p>Your character's ancestry determines which people they call their own, whether that's diverse and ambitious humans, insular but vivacious elves, or traditionalist and family-focused dwarves. Your character's ancestry might be a key part of their identity, shape how they see the world, and help them find their place in it- or what they're rebelling against!</p>
<p>Ancestries determine your hero's Speed and contribute to their Hit Points. Each ancestry also modifies your ability scores in ways which represent that ancestry's basic capabilities. You'll also choose one of the ancestry's heritages, which expand on your character's origins and abilities.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Pick a Background</h3>
<p>Your hero's background might represent their upbringing, an aptitude they've been honing since their youth, or another aspect of their life before they became an adventurer. Your hero's background provides an ability boost and grants a special ability. </p>
<p>The following backgrounds are good choices for a wide range of different characters, but many more are available throughout various Pathfinder Second Edition publications. You can add them to your character sheet simply by dragging them onto it from here.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Choose a Class</h3>
<p>A class gives your hero a suite of heroic abilities and determines their role in a fight. Each class provides further options that let you decide what type of hero you want to be! Will you play a devoted cleric, a mighty fighter, a cunning rogue, or a studious wizard?</p>
<p>To find out more about the four recommended starting classes below, click on their name to open up a journal handout about them.</p>

<p>Depending on your class choice, you'll get an ability boost to your key ability— Wisdom for Clerics, Strength or Dexterity for fighters, Dexterity for Rogues, and Intelligence for Wizards.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Buy Equipment</h3>
<p>Every hero needs @JournalEntry[7bMhPIyyl5QnZb4W]{Equipment}! Begin with the Starting Equipment package for the class you chose, then use the money left over to purchase any extra items you want.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Finish Your Hero</h3>
<p>The last step in creating your hero is to calculate their statistics based on the choices you’ve made in the process. That advice is outlined here: @JournalEntry[cEgjLwy74C6VTvgs]{Finishing your Hero}</p>
