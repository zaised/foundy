<h3>Gathering Places</h3>
<p>Every night, from an hour before sundown to an hour before midnight, Tamily Tanderveil opens the ground floor of the townâ€™s main fishery to sailors, laborers, and travelers alike, offering a comfortable and welcoming place to gather for games and entertainment. A small menu is offered for those who wish to have drinks or snacks while gaming here, the proceeds of which Tamily frequently gives back in the form of contests and prize money for various impromptu gaming tournaments.</p>
