<p>The door to this small shrine is hard to see from the passage, as the ledge is about 10 feet off the ground. A hero must succeed at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:10]{Athletics Skill Check} to climb up to the ledge. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">The ancient wooden door creaks open on rusty hinges, revealing a ruined chamber. Mold and rot stain every surface. On the far side of the room is stone statue of a giant squid, its tentacles reaching toward an altar in the center of the chamber. The scum covers almost everything, but it hasnâ€™t touched the silver bowl sitting atop the stone altar. The water in the bowl is perfectly clear.</p>
<p>If the players ask about the shrine, ask them to roll a @Check[type:religion|dc:15]{Religion Skill Check}. If they succeed, they identify the shrine as one dedicated to Gozreh, the god of nature and the fury of the ocean. If anyone casts detect magic in this chamber, they sense the presence of magic.</p>
<p>The water in the silver bowl is pure and clean, but it carries a touch of Gozreh's magic. Anyone who drinks from the bowl regains [[/r 1d8 #healing]] Hit Points, but they must roll a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20]{Fortitude Save}.</p>
<p><strong>If they fail</strong>, they feel the ocean's waves crash through their stomach, which makes them feel sick for the next hour. They take a -1 status penalty to all d20 rolls, their Armor Class, and spell DCs until the hour has passed. (You can drag this penalty effect to their token from the instructional box below.)</p>
<p><strong>If they succeed</strong> at the Fortitude save, they feel the power of the ocean surge through them. In the next hour, they can call upon the ocean's might to fortify themself against harm. This power is a reaction that the hero can use when hit by a critical hit on an attack. This ability turns the critical success into an ordinary success (so the attack deals normal damage instead of double damage).</p>
<p>Each hero can get the bowl's benefits once per day; drinking a second time in a day has no effect. The bowl loses all of its magic if removed from this shrine, but can be sold for 5 gp.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be difficult to keep track of effects with different durations and triggers. To help you and your players remember the duration of the blessing (or the curse), you can apply these effects to their characters by dragging them from here to their character sheet or onto their token- "Saltwater Sickness" for characters that failed their fortitude save, and "Ocean's Might" for characters that succeeded.</p>
<p>As well as being used to track durations, effects can also apply modifications to your character's stats. For instance, the Saltwater Sickness effect linked above will automatically apply a status penalty to the character's checks and DCs.</p>
