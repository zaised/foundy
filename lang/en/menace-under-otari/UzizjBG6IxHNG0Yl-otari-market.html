<p class="box-text narrative first">The one-stop shop for food, tools, and other everyday gear.</p>
<h3>Goods and Services</h3>
<p>One part open-air farmer’s market, one part log-cabin trading post, the Otari Market is a one-stop shop for most basic goods. Available wares usually include all adventuring gear, light armor, and simple weapons.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>The market’s owner is the dour, humorless Keeleno Lathenar. Keeleno pays handsomely for wolf pelts, as a wolf-like monster slew his wife years ago, and he hopes to one day acquire the skin of her killer.</p>
