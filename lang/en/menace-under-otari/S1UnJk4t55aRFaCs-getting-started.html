<p class="box-text narrative first">Take the first step into an amazing world of fantasy adventure! The Pathfinder Beginner Box contains everything you need to learn how to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, including rules to create your own fantasy hero and tools to make your own amazing stories.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Pathfinder Beginner Box.</p>
<p>This module has been constructed from the ground up to provide you with a simple but detailed introduction to the Pathfinder Second Edition game system, as well as how to make the most out of its features in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. As you progress through the Menace Under Otari adventure, the Journal Entries you read will provide you with instructions on everything from game rules to software usage.</p>
<h2>Inside The Module</h2>
<aside class="bb-float-block">
<h3>Dynamic Links</h3>
<p>Throughout these journals you will find a variety of in-line links. Clicking on these links will take you to another Journal, a Scene, an Actor, or Item sheet providing for fast access and easy navigation to relevant information.</p>
<p>The image that prefaces a link can tell you about the kind of information it contains or what it might do. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>@JournalEntry[vbf3n7v4X54Be9In]{What's a Roleplaying Game?}</p>
<p>An <strong>open book</strong> icon leads to another Journal Entry.</p>
<p>@Actor[r9w1n85mp9Ip4QiS]{Kobold Warrior}</p>
<p>A <strong>silhouette</strong> icon links to an Actor- usually a Player Character, NPC, Hazard, or Loot sheet.</p>
<p>@Scene[c7E7PXzgT5RBkT7S]{Otari}</p>
<p>A <strong>map</strong> links to the settings for a Scene- where maps are shown to you and your players. Though these have been pre-added to the navigation bar based on your import preferences.</p>
<p>@Item[LKjaRu3wDgEBpb9C]{Healing Potion}</p>
<p>A <strong>briefcase</strong> leads to an Item, which can represent a physical item such as a piece of equipment or loot, or a metaphysical one such as a spell or feat.</p>
<p><a class="entity-link" href="https://foundryvtt.com/kb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em class="fas fa-book"> </em>The Foundry VTT Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>A <strong>closed book</strong> is special - these lead to an external website outside of your Foundry world, usually to our official Knowledge Base, which contains more in-depth information on how to use Foundry VTT.</p>
</aside>
<p>The Beginner Box includes carefully organized Journal Entries to share with your friends. While most of this module was designed to be read by the Game Master (GM)— if you are a player, there is still plenty of useful information and instruction in this module for you! The folders have been color-coded to indicate who can see the Journals contained within. If the folder has a red hue it contains game rules and is visible to all players. If the folder has no color assigned, it contains reference material only (such as credits or legal information). If the folder is colored green, it contains secret information that should be visible to GMs only.</p>
<p>Assuming you completed a full import of all content, the folders are structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginners Guide</strong> - Contains Subfolders for Character Creation, Game Mechanics, and Game Mastering which hold the instructions for everything related to running and playing Pathfinder Second Edition</li>
<li><strong>Menace Under Otari </strong>- This folder and its subfolders are filled with the text and artwork needed to run a short adventure designed for up to four players, though clever GMs can increase the difficulty of encounters to accommodate more. The average completion time of the adventure is about two sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Pirate King's Plunder</strong> - A simple adventure designed for solo-play as an introduction to Pathfinder lore and adventure content.</li>
<li><strong>Credits</strong> - All of the individuals who helped to make this content available, as well as the licensing and legal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About Journals</h2>
<p>To keep everything organized, the Journals contained on the Journal Entry Sidebar tab on the right were built with a standardized approach to 'box text' to make it easier to learn. The following are examples of the codified styles used throughout:</p>
<h3>Text Boxes</h3>
<p class="box-text narrative">This is a Narrative box. Within the Menace Under Otari adventure, text which looks like this is expects that the Game Master will read it aloud to the players.</p>
<section class="box-text fvtt"><header><img src="icons/vtt-512.png" width="100" />
<h2>Foundry VTT Advice</h2>
</header>

<section class="box-text encounter"><header><img src="modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/icon-monster.webp" width="100" />

<p>Treasure text boxes contain a summary of special items and goods to reward your players for their successes, and usually follow an encounter.

<h2>Audio and Playlists</h2>
<p>This premium content package includes audio mixed from the awesome sound collection provided by Syrinscape, including some conveniently placed Ambient Audio sources that are placed in key locations on the scene. As Gamemaster, you should take a few moments to familiarize yourself with the available sounds in the Playlists tab, so that you know which ones are available for your use throughout the adventure. For specific instructions on how best to use playlists and what they contain, please see: @JournalEntry[Hd1ivZLqvtBLllSu]{Using Audio}.</p>
<h2>Differences</h2>
<p>The Pathfinder Second Edition game system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop automates many game mechanics in the interest of simplifying gameplay activities for newcomers and veterans alike. The Pathfinder Beginner Box, in its print form, also simplifies many of the rules of the Pathfinder system in the interest of making it easier to get started. In a lot of ways, the overlap between these two simplifications would make the game a lot less interesting and fun, so to provide the best experience for Game Masters as well as players, this module features heavy revisions to the original text of the text of the Beginner Box.</p>
<p>The rules included in this module are specifically tailored for running the Beginner Box content using the Pathfinder Game System for Foundry Virtual Tabletop. As such, the contents of the journal entries are not a one-to-one copy from the rules text outlined in the Game Master's Guide or Heroes Handbook from the PDF or Printed copy of the Beginner box. These changes were made with care to keep the spirit of simplification from the Beginner Box, but more closely align with the full-featured rules of Pathfinder. If you would prefer to use the rules as referenced from the original source material, the purchase of this product also provides access to PDF copies of those texts.</p>
<p>The adventure text for Menace Under Otari and Pirate King's Plunder remain unchanged, except for places which instruct users on how to use the Pathfinder Second Edition game system for Foundry VTT.</p>
