<h3>Dangerous Places</h3>
<p>The old hills and forests around Otari have been inhabited since long before the town existed. Fallen fortresses of would-be warlords, dank barrows crawling with undead, and caves filled with monsters and forgotten treasure lie within a few hours’ walk of Otari. Many locals have heard the rumors of danger and treasure in the Otari hinterlands, and it’s up to adventurers to discover whether these tales hold any truth!</p>
