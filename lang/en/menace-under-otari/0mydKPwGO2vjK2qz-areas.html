<p>Some effects occupy an area of a specified shape and size. There are three types of areas: bursts, cones, and lines. Usually, an ability with an area affects everyone in the area. For instance, if you cast the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.y6rAdMK6EFlV6U0t]{Burning Hands} spell, everyone in its cone- friend or foe!- must attempt a Reflex save, and if they fail, they take fire damage. A creature that's inside the area but totally behind a barrier, such as on the other side of a wall from your area's origin, isn't affected by the effect.</p>
<p>• <strong>Burst</strong>: A sphere expanding out from the center. You can set the center of the burst on any grid intersection in range.</p>
<p>• <strong>Cone</strong>: A quarter-circle shoots out from you. Choose whether to aim the cone straight out from you or diagonally when you use the ability.</p>
<p>• <strong>Line</strong>: A straight line shoots from a corner of your square in a direction you choose.</p>

<p>Foundry VTT provides a useful Templates feature that allows you to place area effects. There are template shapes for circles, cones, rectangles, and rays- covering all of the needs of the Pathfinder system. In addition, many of the spells in Pathfinder Second Edition come preconfigured with their areas, and will have a button in the spellcard that allows you to easily place a template!</p>
<p>If you'd like to place a template manually, you can also use "Measurement Controls" from the toolbar. Templates that you place are automatically colored to match your assigned player color.</p>
<p>To delete a template that you have placed, simply hover over its placement icon and press delete.</p>
