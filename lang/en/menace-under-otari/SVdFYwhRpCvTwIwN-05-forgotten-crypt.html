<p>This chamber contains a number of undead creatures, and it could make for a very dangerous encounter if the players arenâ€™t careful. When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Beyond the barricade, an old cavern corridor winds down into the earth, ending in an ancient burial vault lit by a strange torch with a blue flame. Alcoves line the walls, each one containing a rotten wooden coffin, while the center of the room has a raised platform holding a stone sarcophagus.</p>

<h3>Audio Cue</h3>
<p>The audio track "The Malevolent Dead" can be played here to give your players some warning of what they are about to walk into. It has not been placed on the scene as an Ambient Sound to allow those GMs who wish to surprise their players with the undead to do so.</p>
</aside>
<p>This crypt holds foul undead creatures that rise to attack any living thing foolish enough to disturb their slumber. If the players made a lot of noise breaking through the barricade in @JournalEntry[YAfr3rITEAgMznAS]{Area 04}, the skeletons and zombie have already broken free from their coffins and are standing, ready for a fight. But if the heroes were quiet when they took apart the barricade, the undead are still in their coffins, and combat begins when they push aside their lids as soon as the heroes enter. In this case, each undead must use their first action on their first turn just to Stand.</p>
<p>Like for the other fights, first ask the players to roll Perception for initiative. The skeletons and zombie also roll Perception for initiative.</p>

<h3>Undead Abilities</h3>
<p>These undead have special rules that affect how they take @JournalEntry[BmyKEDSSROeZktZE]{Damage}. Skeletons have some <strong>damage resistances</strong>, reducing incoming damage of certain types as listed on its character sheet above, while Zombies have <strong>weaknesses</strong> and are especially vulnerable to Slashing and Positive damage. Make sure to check these against the weapons or spells your players are using to be sure that you account for that!</p>
<p>Both types of undead also have <strong>immunities </strong>that prevent certain types of damage and abilities from affecting them. They aren't affected by anything with the mental trait, they don't take poison damage, and they can't fall unconscious- even from effects with the nonlethal trait.</p>
<p>Zombies have one more special ability called <strong>Slow</strong> that represents their ponderous, staggering movements. Due to being permanently @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}, A zombie can use only 2 actions on its turn each round instead of 3, and can't use reactions at all!</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>This fight is especially challenging! For destroying the undead creatures here, award each hero 100 XP.</p>

<p>After the fight, the heroes have time to look around the room for treasure. The torch is a special magic item called an <em>everburning torch</em> that emits light constantly. Although it looks like fire, it emits no heat and can't be extinguished!</p>
<figure class="right shadow"><img class="noborder" src="modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-items/lion-shield.webp" width="130" /></figure>
<p>If the players take the torch, remember to turn off the light in the room by going to lighting layer (the light-bulb icon on the toolbar) and right-clicking it.</p>
<p>In addition, one of the skeletons was buried with a polished shield carved to look like a roaring lion. It can be used as a shield, or the heroes can sell it for 5 gp due to its fine artistry.</p>
