<h3>Landmarks</h3>
<p>A total of two dozen standing stones, each exactly 12 feet high, stand like sentries around the shores of a shallow pond. The site is usually occupied by polite but aloof pilgrims of Desna or of Gozreh, the god of nature. A kindly nature priest named Worliwynn is the siteâ€™s only permanent resident, and she helps the loggers work harmoniously with nature.</p>
