<p>This cavern is the home of the wyrmling green dragon hatched by the kobold band. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Towering yellow mushrooms cover the floor of this vast cave, some reaching over ten feet in height. They seem to emit a pale light, giving the entire chamber an eerie glow. Shattered remnants of barrels—torn open with their contents nowhere to be seen—lay scattered around the base of the mushrooms. Somewhere off on the far side of the chamber, something stirs, and a faint snarl comes from the shadows.</p>
<p>The towering mushrooms block the view of the far side of the room, but the heroes might try to climb the mushrooms to get a better look. Due to their slippery caps, climbing a mushroom is a tricky task, requiring a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:20|showDC:all]{Athletics skill check}.</p>
<p>Give the heroes a chance to prepare themselves, but when one of them climbs atop a mushroom or reaches the center of the room, the dragon leaves their lair in the far corner to attack. Reveal the dragon's token on the map and read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">A bright-green dragon leaps into view, and although the beast isn't much larger than you, large leathery wings and snapping jaws make the hatchling look like an ancient wyrm. The creature gazes at you with cunning eyes and snorts a cloud of yellow vapor. With a fierce roar, the dragon charges forward to attack!</p>
<p>Ask the players to roll Perception for initiative (but heroes who were hiding roll Stealth instead) while you roll Perception to determine the dragon's initiative.</p>
<p>Dragons are one of the fiercest and most challenging types of opponents in the game, and while only a wyrmling, this one is still a deadly threat. The dragon uses many abilities in the fight against the heroes and is fiercely territorial of the cave. However, the kobolds have trained the hatchling to stay in this area, so the heroes can retreat if they need to recover.</p>

<h2>Encounter</h2>

<article>
<h3>Breath Weapon</h3>
<p>The dragon can spend 2 actions to breathe out a cloud of deadly gas that deals poison damage to everyone in a @Template[type:cone|distance:30|traits:evocation,poison,arcane]{30-foot cone} starting from the dragon's space.</p>
<p>This attack could spell doom for the party, but the wyrmling doesn’t have much experience using their breath weapon effectively. The dragon doesn't try to catch all the heroes with this attack, but focuses on just the nearest opponent. Once the dragon uses the breath weapon ability, they can’t use it again for [[/r 1d4]] rounds or until they get a critical hit on a Strike.</p>
<h3>Special Attacks</h3>
<p>The dragon's favorite tactic (and most reliable attack) is to <strong>Stride</strong> forward and then use <strong>Draconic Frenzy</strong>, an ability that allows the beast to spend 2 actions to make two claw Strikes and a tail Strike in any order. The second and third Strikes during the Draconic Frenzy take the multiple attack penalty: –5 on the second attack (or –4 if the second attack uses a claw Strike), and –10 on the third attack (or –8 if using a claw).</p>
<p>The dragon also has a special <strong>Twisting Tail</strong> reaction. When someone within 10 feet tries to move, the dragon can spend their reaction for that round to make a tail Strike against that foe. If the dragon hits, the target stops moving and loses the rest of that action (though the target can use another action to move again if they want).</p>

<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>Once the heroes manage to defeat the dragon, award each hero 120 XP.</p>

<h2>Treasure</h2>

<p>The ledge in the northeast corner of the room holds the treasure the kobolds offered to the dragon. The heroes can catch a glimpse of this treasure even from the floor, but anyone who wants to climb up to the ledge must succeed at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|showDC:all]{Athletics skill check}.</p>
<p>Atop the ledge sits a small chest and a huge pile of coins, totalling 429 cp, 63 sp, and 18 gp. There's also a single giant emerald atop the heap that vaguely looks like the dragon's eye, which can be sold for 20 gp.</p>

<h2>Tunnel to the Surface</h2>
<p>The back of the mushroom grotto has a tunnel leading to a long, winding passageway. If the heroes explore this way, they find that it gently slopes upward, and they can feel a fresh breeze coming from this direction. After following this path for over an hour, they emerge from a small cave in a ravine outside the town of Otari. Remnants of a camp around the cave’s entrance indicate that the kobolds had stayed here for some time before heading under the town to work their mischief.</p>

<h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
<p>With a lot of courage and a bit of luck, the adventurers hopefully survived their encounter with the kobolds and their “pet,” returning to the town as triumphant heroes! Tamily feels truly relieved to learn that the threat is gone, especially after learning just how dangerous it was.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, news of the heroes' exploits travel all across town, and soon they receive opportunities for more adventuring work. Such adventures are up to you, the GM, to determine, but you might find the resources in the @JournalEntry[NNmKsnjJOZogP2fO]{Otari Gazetteer} useful if your group would like to continue with the same heroes! In that case, you might be interested in the Troubles in Otari adventure or the Abomination Vaults adventure path, both of which continue the stories of Otari's many characters.</p>
