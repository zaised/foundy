<p>Weather can be combined with @JournalEntry[oiCmDc80T3El2rDj]{Environments} to establish a mood or to make more memorable encounters. Weather can impose circumstance penalties on certain checks, from -1 to -4 based on severity.</p>

<h3>Fog</h3>
<p>Fog imposes a circumstance penalty on visual Perception checks: -1 for light fog or -2 for heavy fog. Creatures viewed through significantly thick fog have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition. You decide the distance of that concealment, but it’s usually around 30 feet for a light fog and 15 feet for a heavy fog.</p>

<h3>Precipitation</h3>
<p>Precipitation includes rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Wet precipitation douses flames, and frozen precipitation can create areas of snow or ice on the ground. Drizzle or light snowfall has little mechanical effect beyond limited visibility.</p>
<p>Most forms of precipitation impose circumstance penalties on vision-based Perception checks, usually a -1 circumstance penalty or -2 for heavier precipitation. Hail often is sparser but loud, instead causing a -2 circumstance penalty on hearing-based Perception checks. Especially heavy precipitation, such as a downpour of rain or heavy snow, might make creatures concealed if they’re far away.</p>

<h3>Thunderstorms</h3>
<p>High winds and heavy precipitation accompany many thunderstorms. There’s also a very small chance that a creature might be struck by lightning during a storm. A lightning strike usually deals [[/r 5d6 #electricity]] electricity damage.</p>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>In most places, even if it’s very cold or hot, the weather isn’t actively dangerous. However, temperatures of 105º F and above or 12º F or below can be harmful! For every hour spent in temperatures from 105º to 114º, a creature takes [[/r 1d6 #fire]] fire damage. For every hour spent in temperatures from -21º to 12º, a creature takes [[/r 1d6 #cold]] cold damage. Temperatures beyond those ranges are too dangerous for characters of levels 1-3.</p>

<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>Wind imposes a penalty on Perception checks to hear and on physical ranged attacks such as arrows. This circumstance penalty is -1 for a weak wind or -2 for a stronger wind. Powerful windstorms can make physical ranged attacks impossible! Wind snuffs out handheld flames. Particularly strong winds might require a creature to succeed at a DC 15 Athletics check each time it attempts to move. On a failure, the creature doesn’t move on that action, and on a critical failure, it’s knocked back 5 feet and falls prone. Any moderate or strong wind is difficult terrain for a flying monster moving against the wind.</p>
