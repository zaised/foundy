<p>Ezren was raised as a younger son of a successful spice merchant. He enjoyed the comforts of a well-to-do family, lived in a neighborhood that was relatively free of crime, and had no lofty ambitions. However, when the church of the merchant god accused his father of heresy and corruption, ruining the family business, Ezren was determined to prove his father's innocence. To his shock, the church's accusations were true. Outraged, Ezren left his home and began studying magic on his own, as no wizard would take a 40-year-old as an apprentice. Now he wants to travel the world and make a difference in other peoples' lives.</p>
<p>Ezren is skeptical of human nature, instead putting his trust in his own brilliant intellect and magical abilities.</p>
