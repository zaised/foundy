<p class="box-text narrative first">As an ancient people, elves have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history. The world has changed around them, and they struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from terrible demons that have infested their lands. Though renowned for their grace, beauty, and knowledge, they place far more importance on personal freedom.</p>

<h1>Playing an Elf</h1>
<p>Choose the @Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0]{Elf} ancestry by dragging it onto your character sheet. This will automatically apply several of the features associated with the Elf ancestry to your character, which are explained here.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> Elves are slender and slightly frailer compared to other ancestries. You start with 6 hit points from your ancestry.</p>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> With their long legs and easy grace, elves are a bit faster than people of most ancestries. Your starting Speed is 30.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Light Vision:</strong> Elves can see well in dim light. This makes it easier for you to target creatures that are in shadow.</p>
<h3>Names</h3>
<p>An elf keeps their personal name secret from those outside their family, giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim. An elf might be known by many different names to associates of varying ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically- at least in the Elven tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Names</strong>: Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon</p>

<h2>Elf Heritages</h2>
<p>Like for most folk in the world, there are many different kinds of elves, hailing from different regions and families. Pick one of the following heritages and write it in the Heritage area under your ancestry . Then add its abilities to your character sheet.</p>
<p>Elves can live for hundreds of years, and after spending enough time in one locale, they adapt to match their surroundings. Their skin and hair can even change, such as woodland elves taking on the colors of the trees and leaves around them. Therefore, many elf heritages are connected to the environments in which they live. We suggest you pick one of the following heritages.</p>
