<p>You can carry items in three ways: held, worn, or stowed. Held items are in your hands. You can hold one item in each hand or one two-handed item using both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth. You can retrieve a worn item with a single action, and putting it back uses another action. As usual, manipulating objects uses the Interact basic action. You can drop an item without spending an action. Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container, and you have to spend an action to take off the backpack before you can spend the Interact action to retrieve an item stowed within.</p>

<h2>Held Items in Foundry</h2>

<p>You can control how an item your character owns is held or worn by clicking on the hand icon beside it in your inventory, which allows you to choose between held, worn, dropped, and so on. Setting an item as "held" will enable certain functions, like making the weapon's strike appear on your actions tab, or creating a light effect in the case of a torch.</p>

<p>Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, making a Strike with a dagger worn in a sheath at your belt requires using an Interact action to draw the dagger and then using a second action to Strike. Likewise, you have to draw a potion from your pocket or belt pouch before you can Interact to drink it.</p>
<h3>Hands</h3>
<p>Each itemâ€™s entry on the table says how many hands it takes to use the item. Most items that require two hands can be carried in only one hand, but you must spend an Interact action to change your grip in order to use the item. The GM may determine that an item is too big to carry in one hand (or even two hands, for particularly large items).</p>
<h3>Wearing Tools</h3>
<p>You can make a set of tools (such as a climbing kit or healer's tools) easier to use by wearing it. This allows you to draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them. Any tools not worn in this manner must be stowed or taken out with an Interact action.</p>
