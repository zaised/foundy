<p>After dealing with the rats, the heroes are free to explore the hole in the east wall of the storeroom. It is big enough for a human to crawl through with ease. Once the first hero enters the area beyond, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Squeezing through the hole, you find yourself in a cavern that seems to stretch endlessly beneath the streets of Otari. Who knows what menace could be lurking down here? Up ahead, the passageway ends in a cliff that plunges sharply into the darkness.</p>
<p>The monsters that broke into the storeroom used this passageway to break through the wall, but they came from much deeper parts of the vast series of caverns beneath Otari.</p>
<h2>Skill Checks</h2>
<p>To continue on their adventure, the players must find a way to climb down a short, slippery cliff. Instead of using combat abilities, the heroes each need to attempt a @JournalEntry[IpshSeAFYWe1xNaU]{Skill Check} to see if they succeed or fail. This check requires the Athletics skill, which is used for climbing up and down walls, ropes, and trees. A list of the other skills and their uses can be found @JournalEntry[ImGyOYVIN6WeuOT4]{here}.</p>
<p>The cliff is only 10 feet tall, but the surface is slick with moisture. @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} safely requires a @Check[type:athletics|dc:15]{Athletics Skill Check}.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that the skill check above is actually a button! Clicking it while you have a token selected will use that creature's statistics to resolve the check- in this case, an Athletics skill check with a DC of 15. The resulting chat card will take into account your modifiers and give you your degree of success, automatically.</p>
<p>Of course, ideally, you'd want your players to be able to roll that check. While you can still ask for an athletics skill check and compare the result to the DC yourself, another option is to press the little speech bubble icon on the check button. This will post the button to chat without sharing any of the GM-only text that surrounds it, allowing your players to easily roll their skill checks without risk of spoilers!</p>

<h3>Rope and Other Forms of Aid</h3>
<p>The players might decide to use rope to help them scale the cliff. They can easily tie a rope to one of numerous sturdy stalagmites nearby. Once this is done, the Athletics check to climb up or down is only a @Check[type:athletics|dc:10]{Athletics Skill Check}; a character critically fails only by rolling a 1 on the die, and they score a critical success if the total is 20 or higher.</p>
<p>The heroes might also try and help each other get up and down. A character helping someone else climb must attempt their own Athletics check to assist. If they succeed, the character climbing gets a +1 circumstance bonus to their check (+2 if the assisting character critically succeeds). A hero providing assistance must still roll their own Athletics check to climb up or down themself.</p>

<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>Once the heroes have all climbed down the cliff, award them each 10 XP for overcoming this challenge.</p>
<h2>Exploring the Dungeon</h2>
<p>Once the heroes climb down the cliff, they can continue onward to the next area. There is little of interest in this tunnel, but anyone who looks can find a trail in the dust and grime, making it clear that creatures have come this way in the recent past. Moisture and time have obscured any details such as footprints, however. The mushrooms in the lower part of the chamber are particularly bitter, but edible.</p>
<p>From this point onward, the characters are free to explore the dungeon at their own pace. They can continue to press forward, or they can retreat back to the town above to rest and get new supplies.</p>
<p>Once the heroes have explored an area, that area remains as the heroes left it the last time they were there. Any monsters left alive recover lost Hit Points, but those that were killed remain dead upon the heroes’ return.</p>
<h3>Light</h3>
<p>From this area onward, the chambers are completely dark unless their descriptions state otherwise. Characters who have darkvision from their ancestry or heritage can see normally. Others need to provide their own source of light so that they can see. As long as one character is holding a torch, most of the rooms are small enough that the torch illuminates the entire area.</p>

<h2>Rules-Based Lighting</h2>

<p>Foundry VTT supports dynamic lighting, which means that tokens can carry light sources around with them as they move. Moreover, the Pathfinder Second Edition system integrates this lighting system with the rules, appropriately upgrading lighting levels based on a character's senses so long as you have "rules-based vision" enabled under "automation" in your system settings. </p>
<p>If one of your players has access to a torch, or the <em>light </em>spell, they might want to make use of those tools here. There's no need to edit their token directly however- instead, if they @JournalEntry[sFnjBfCH4q6L9ryB]{equip} the torch in a hand, or drag the Light effect from their spellcard to their token, they will immediately begin emanating a light source which will illuminate the scene for the player and their allies.</p>
