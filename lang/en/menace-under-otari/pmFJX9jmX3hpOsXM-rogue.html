<p class="box-text narrative first">Using your wits and quick reactions, you take advantage of your opponents' missteps to strike where it hurts most. You seek thrills and test your skills, and you likely don’t care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While every rogue follows a unique path, the one thing you all share is the breadth and depth of your skills.</p>

<p>Merisiel is an elf who grew up as an orphan among humans. She is a master at stowing away on ships and has called dozens of cities home, leaving one place for another after her human companions grew old and she stayed young. Merisiel has never met a problem that couldn't be solved with a knife in one way or another. But when stabbing's not the best solution, she makes up for it by being incredibly agile and skilled with small objects, such as lockpicks. </p>
<p>Merisiel's life experiences have taught her to enjoy things in the moment and to their fullest-it's impossible to tell when the good times might end. She's open and expressive with her thoughts and emotions, and while she's always on the move and working on her latest batch of schemes for easy money, in the end all her plots come down to being faster than everyone else-either on her feet, or with her beloved blades. She wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
