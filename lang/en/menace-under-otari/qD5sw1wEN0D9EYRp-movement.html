<p>Foundry VTT renders a grid on scenes which provides automatic snapping and tracking of movement distances. Typically in Pathfinder, a single grid square is equal to 5 feet, the space a Medium creature (like each of the heroes) would occupy. Small creatures also occupy this space, but typically have tokens scaled down just slightly by the Pathfinder System to give a visual cue of their smaller size. Large creatures occupy a space of 2x2 squares, and each size increments this space by 1 in both dimensions.</p>
<p>Foundry VTT provides a number of ways to move a controlled token, but the most common is to use the arrow keys on your keyboard or to click and drag the token from one position to another. During encounters or other times when movement is limited, you can measure your movements by holding the ctrl key, clicking your token, and placing waypoints on the way to your destination by clicking as many times as you'd like. This will display a measurement of the distance that move would cover. Pressing the space bar while the measurement is visible will execute the move, and your token will progress through the way points to your destination.</p>

<h2>Difficult Terrain</h2>
<p>Whenever creatures need to cross terrain that’s hard to move through, such as snow or underbrush, you can use the rules for difficult terrain. Difficult terrain costs 5 more feet of movement to move into.</p>
<h2>Reactions to Movement</h2>
<p>Some reactions are triggered by a creature using an action with the move trait. The most notable example is Attack of Opportunity, which fighters and some monsters have. A creature with Attack of Opportunity can use it when a nearby enemy uses an action with the move trait or when an enemy leaves a nearby square. The Step basic action doesn’t trigger reactions based on movement and neither does movement caused by other creatures, like a Shove.</p>
<h2>Moving Through a Creature</h2>
<p>You can move through the space of any creature willing to let you. If you want to move through an unwilling creature’s space, you can Tumble Through that creature’s space using Acrobatics. You can’t end your turn in a square occupied by another creature, though you can end a move action in its square provided that you immediately use another move action to leave that square. If two creatures end up in the same square by accident, the GM determines which one is forced out of the square (or whether one falls over and gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone condition}).</p>
<p>You can stand in the same square as a prone creature if that creature is willing, unconscious, or dead and is your size or smaller. The GM might allow you to climb atop a larger creature that’s dead or unconscious in some situations.</p>
<h2>Falling</h2>
<p>When you fall more than 5 feet, upon landing you take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a fall, you fall over and gain the prone condition.</p>
<p>You can Grab an Edge as a reaction to reduce the damage from some falls. Roll a Reflex save against the DC to Climb the surface (as chosen by the GM). If you succeed, you catch yourself and take damage as though the fall were 20 feet shorter (or 30 feet shorter on a critical success). On a critical failure, you take 10 bludgeoning damage for every 20 feet you’ve fallen, then keep falling!</p>

<h2>Moving on a Grid</h2>
<p>When a character moves on a grid, every square of the play area is 5 feet across in the game world.</p>
<p>Because moving diagonally covers more ground, you count that movement differently. The first square of diagonal movement you make in a turn counts as 5 feet, but the second counts as 10 feet, and your count thereafter alternates between the two. </p>
<p>In this example, Valeros Strides so he can move up to his Speed, which is 25 feet. He moves 5 feet horizontally, then his first diagonal costs 5 more feet. Now his second diagonal costs 10 feet! For the last square of movement, taking another diagonal would take 5 feet, but moving horizontally into the rubble would take 10 feet because the rubble is difficult terrain. If Valeros moved up or down instead, he could move 1 square.</p>
