<p>Several parts of this book, most notably Skills, state that you as the GM set the DCs for certain checks or determine other parameters. Here are guidelines for the most common tasks, with Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation grouped together under “Social Skills.” Anything more difficult than what’s listed here uses the <strong>Master</strong> DC of 30. Remember that all of these are guidelines, and you can adjust them as necessary to suit the situation.</p>
<h3>Balance (Acrobatics)</h3>
<p>Use @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Simple DCs} based on what the character is trying to balance across.</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) tangled roots, uneven cobblestones</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) wooden beam</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) deep, loose gravel</p>
<h3>Climb (Athletics)</h3>
<p>Use @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Simple DCs} based on what the character is trying to climb up or across.</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) ladder, low-branched tree, steep slope</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) rigging, rope, typical tree</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) wall with small handholds and footholds</p>
<h3>Decipher Writing</h3>
<p>Base the DC on how complex and hard to understand the text is. A hero doesn’t need to roll to read a text that’s written in plain language.</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) entry-level philosophy treatise</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) complex code, such as a cipher</p>
<h3>Gather Information (Diplomacy)</h3>
<p>To set the DC to Gather Information, use a  @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Simple DC}  representing the availability of information about the subject. Adjust the DC upward if the hero seeks in-depth information.</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) talk of the town</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) common rumor</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) obscure rumor, poorly guarded secret</p>
<h3>Identify Magic or Learn a Spell</h3>
<p>The DC to Identify Magic or Learn a Spell is the  @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{level-based DC}  for the spell or item’s level.</p>
<h3>Perform (Performance)</h3>
<p>Consider the audience’s exposure to the arts when picking the @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Simple DC}. How easy are they to impress?</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) audience of commoners</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) audience of artisans</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) audience of merchants or minor nobles</p>
<h3>Recall Knowledge</h3>
<p>On most topics, you can use simple DCs for checks to Recall Knowledge. For a check about a specific creature, trap, or other subject with a level, use a  @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{level-based DC} . You might adjust the difficulty down, maybe even drastically if the subject is famous.</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) name of a ruler, key noble, or major deity</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) line of succession for a major noble family, core doctrines of a major deity</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) genealogy of a minor noble, teachings of an ancient priest</p>
<p>Sometimes a hero might want to follow up on a check to Recall Knowledge by attempting another check to discover more information. This can sometimes work, but you should adjust the difficulty to be higher for each follow-up attempt. Once a hero has attempted an incredibly hard check or failed a check, further attempts are fruitless—the hero has recalled everything they know about the subject.</p>
<p>Information on using Recall Knowledge to identify monsters is in the @JournalEntry[SMSdqNDuTRqYHYSJ]{Creatures} handout.</p>
<h3>Sense Direction (Survival)</h3>
<p>Pick the most appropriate  @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Simple DC} when someone uses Survival to Sense Direction.</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) determine a cardinal direction using the sun</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) find an overgrown path in a forest</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) navigate a hedge maze</p>
<h3>Social Skills</h3>
<p>When a hero uses Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation to influence or impress someone whose level or Will DC you don’t know, estimate the level of the creature and use that DC. A commoner’s level is usually 0 or 1. Don’t worry about being exact. It often makes sense to adjust the DC based on the target’s attitude, using one of the easy DC adjustments if the creature is more friendly or a hard DC adjustment if they dislike the hero. Remember that NPCs aren’t robots. If they’d be unlikely to do something, you can make the DC harder or even impossible!</p>
<h3>Swim (Athletics)</h3>
<p>Use  @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Simple DCs} based on how turbulent the water is.</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) lake or other still water</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) flowing water, like a river</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) swiftly flowing river</p>
<h3>Track (Survival)</h3>
<p>Pick a  @JournalEntry[Z2vfZwOvFFPkEPqA]{Simple DC}. You can adjust the DC to Track based on weather, terrain, and other factors.</p>
<p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) the path of a large army following a road</p>
<p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear across the tundra</p>
<p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) a nimble panther’s tracks through a jungle, tracks obscured by rainfall</p>
