<p>Ability Scores represent your hero’s raw potential. They influence almost every other statistic on your character sheet. Although they start at 10- representing roughly average ability- they will change over the course of character creation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the Creating Your Hero handout, the specifics of character building can vary wildly between the core rules and the more streamlined rules included within the Beginner Box. As always, if there is any doubt, make sure to ask your GM which version of the rules you're using, and to consult the rulebooks directly to get the facts straight from the source. The Pathfinder Second Edition system for Foundry operates under the assumption you are playing with the core rules. If you are using the Beginner Box rules, the information contained with the class item's "details" tab may not apply to your character.</p>
<h3>Ability Boosts</h3>
<p>In the Pathfinder Second Edition core rules, an "ability boost" is granted by several of the choices you make at character creation. In this context, it means you should increase the associated ability score by two- for instance, from 10 to 12- and the associated ability modifier by one- for instance, from +0 to +1.</p>
<p>At times, the Beginner Box will tell you to increase your ability modifier by one. This is equivalent to an Ability Boost and should increase your ability scores by the same amount- it does not mean that you increase your score by one (for example, from 10 to 11).</p>
<h3>Ability Scores in the Core Rules</h3>
<p>In the Core Rules, you gain ability boosts from your Ancestry, your Background, and your Class. In addition, you gain four free ability boosts that you can place anywhere you wish (although not twice in the same ability score). Your Ancestry might also come with an Ability Flaw, such as a malus to charisma for dwarves. Finally, you also have the option of reducing two of your ability scores by 2 each to increase a third by 2, which is called a "Voluntary Flaw". This cannot be used to boost an ability score which is already increased by your ancestry.</p>
<h3>Ability Scores in the Beginner Box</h3>
<p>In the Beginner Box rules, you gain ability boosts from your Ancestry, your Background, and your class. You do not get "free" ability boosts, and your ancestry will not penalise your ability scores with Ability Flaws, nor do you have the option of choosing a "Voluntary Flaw".</p>
<h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>
<p>If you're planning on running the adventure Menace Under Otari for Pathfinder Society organised play, it becomes especially important that you take into account which version of the rules you use to create your characters. If you haven't already, consult the @JournalEntry[x76hH0AqjPcVnEKQ]{Pathfinder Society} journal to find out more.</p>
