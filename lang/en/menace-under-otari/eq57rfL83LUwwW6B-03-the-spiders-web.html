<p>This room contains thick webs and an enormous spider. The Giant Spider token has already been placed on the scene for you, but like the rats in the previous encounter is hidden from player view. When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">The tunnel continues deeper underground, eventually opening into a large chamber. Patches of glowing blue fungus cling to the ceiling and provide dim light. You can just barely make out vast strands of webbing across the floor and walls of this cavern, stretching between stalactites like shimmering curtains.</p>
<p>This fight uses the same rules as the first fight against the rats, but it also incorporates skill checks when dealing with webs and includes a new kind of @JournalEntry[IpshSeAFYWe1xNaU]{Check}—a saving throw—to resist the spider’s poisonous bite!</p>
<p>This chamber is home to a very big spider, waiting to ambush anything that wanders through its web. The webs aren’t sticky enough to make anyone who touches them unable to move, but they do slow characters down. Each square that has webbing in it is difficult terrain—terrain that’s particularly hard to move through. Moving into a square of difficult terrain costs an extra 5 feet of movement, and a creature can’t Step into a square of difficult terrain. The spider isn’t affected by its webs and can move normally throughout the chamber.</p>
<p>When the players enter the chamber, the spider is in its lair in the northeast corner of the room. It does not emerge to attack until someone touches one of its webs. Anyone trying to cross through the room without touching the webs must attempt an @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:15]{Acrobatics Skill Check} to carefully balance on rocks and narrow ledges. If anyone fails the check, the spider senses them in the room and emerges to attack.</p>
<p>The fight with the spider plays out very much like the combat with the rats. As soon as someone touches one of the webs or fails an Acrobatics check to balance while crossing the room, call for everyone to roll for initiative—usually using Perception, or Stealth for anyone who was hiding at the time. The spider rolls Perception for its initiative.</p>
<p>After you have everyone’s initiative results, start the first round of combat with the character who rolled the highest initiative result. Each character gets to use 3 actions when their turn comes up, and when everyone has had a turn, start over again at the beginning.</p>
<p>The heroes might avoid this fight by carefully moving around the webs. They might also flee from the spider. The spider refuses to leave this area, retreating to its webbed den in the northeast if all the heroes flee.</p>

<h2>Spider Fight</h2>

<h3>Saving Throws</h3>
<p>Whenever the spider manages to successfully attack a character with its fangs, it injects poison as part of the attack. Whenever a character is subjected to poison, they must attempt a special check called a saving throw to resist its effects. There are three types of saving throw: a Fortitude save is typically for resisting poison or disease, a Reflex save is for dodging away from falling debris or avoiding a deadly beam from a spell, and a Will save is usually for resisting spells and magic that befuddle the mind.</p>
<p>Anyone who is bitten by the spider must immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw by clicking the d20 icon under "Fortitude" in the saves section of their character sheet. If the result is equal to or greater than 16, they resist the poison and suffer no ill effect. If the result is less than 16, the poison takes hold! The details of the poison's effects are included in its stat block.</p>
<h3>Ranged Strikes</h3>
<p>The giant spider also has a special ranged Strike that lets it throw webbing to trap a nearby creature. Unlike for a melee Strike, the giant spider doesn’t have to be adjacent to a hero to target them with a ranged Strike—it can target a hero anywhere in the room. Otherwise, a ranged Strike works just like a melee Strike. Choose a target by hovering over the token and pressing T, then click the "Strike+ 7" button on the giant spider’s Web Strike, and then compare the total to the Armor Class of the target hero to see if it hits.</p>
<p>While ranged Strikes normally deal damage just like melee Strikes, this web Strike is special. If the attack roll is a success, the target doesn’t take any damage. Instead, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} and can’t move out of their square until they successfully use the Escape basic action. You can apply the Immobilized effect by dragging it from this journal directly to the affected token. The target can attempt a check to Escape using the Acrobatics skill or Athletics skill, or a fists attack roll, and the DC is 17. Each attempt to Escape is a single action.</p>
<p>If the total result of the check to Escape is 17 or greater, the target breaks free from the webs and can move freely. You can remove the immobilization effect by right-clicking on the affected token, clicking the "Assign Status Effects" button on the right, and then right-clicking the immobilized effect.  A stuck hero can still attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally, but they can’t move from their current space on the map.</p>

<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>Sometimes challenges offer multiple ways for the heroes to overcome them. No matter how the heroes overcome a challenge, they earn XP for doing so- but only the first time they overcome it! If the heroes avoid the fight with the spider and you award them XP for doing so, they don't get more XP if they later go back and fight the spider.</p>
<p>The first time the heroes get past the spider, whether by defeating or avoiding it, award them each 40 XP.</p>

<h2>Searching the Spider's Lair</h2>

<article>
<p>Once the heroes defeat the spider, the players might think to check the spider's lair to see if there is anything of value hidden in the webs. Ask anyone who explores the area to attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:15]{Perception Check}. If they succeed, they spot a wrapped up bundle of bones and dried skin that looks like it was some sort of small, reptilian creature (in fact, it's a kobold, one of the creatures responsible for breaking into the basement of the fishery).</p>
<p>The bundle also contains a few items of value- a healing potion and a shortsword that has a small emerald in the pommel. While the sword isn't magical, the fine craftsmanship and precious gem make it worth 5 gp if sold.</p>
<h3>Loot Actors</h3>
<p>The Pathfinder Second Edition system includes compendiums containing every item released by Paizo under the OGL license, which makes handing out loot to players a breeze. To save you even more time, though, we've placed a special type of actor called a "loot actor" on the scene with the items ready for them to pick up. If your players locate the kobold's remains, you can simply reveal the actor on the map, and they'll be able to open its inventory and see (and claim!) the items within.</p>
<p>Several future rooms include loot actors like this one, so keep an eye out for these boxes!</p>
<h3>Special Items</h3>
<figure class="right shadow"><img class="noborder" src="modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-items/healing-potion.webp" width="100" /></figure>
<p>One of the items inside the loot sheet- the @Item[LKjaRu3wDgEBpb9C]{Healing Potion}- is a magical consumable. A small number of special items in this adventure may have unique artwork, which you can share with your players by right-clicking on it in the items tab and clicking "view item artwork" followed by "show to players".</p>
<p>If you'd like, you can use the mystification feature to hide the names and descriptions of items that the players have yet to identify. To do this, before you reveal the loot sheet, click on the question mark icon on the corresponding item within its inventory.</p>

<h2>Avoiding the Threat</h2>
<p>If the heroes are very careful moving around this room, they might avoid the fight with the spider entirely. They might also flee from the spider, moving past the encounter in this area without defeating it. In either case, the spider remains a threat every time the heroes pass through this chamber.</p>
<p>In some adventures, the situation changes if the players take too long or rest too often, but this adventure and its encounter remain the same no matter how long the players take in exploring this dungeon. Any creatures the heroes defeat remain dead or destroyed, and any creatures they avoid remain in the same place—potentially posing a danger if the heroes pass through that area again later!</p>
