<h1>The First Adventure</h1>
<p>"Menace under Otari" is designed to teach new Game Masters and players how to play Pathfinder. Each section of the adventure will teach new concepts as you need them, adding more and more to the game. Meanwhile, the other players each have an entire hero to roleplay as, learning how to use their abilities and how to succeed in the dangerous world that they find themselves exploring.</p>
<p>If you're the Game Master and you want to play with your friends right now, start with this adventure. It walks you and the other players through how to play, giving you a chance to learn together. If you don't want to play right away, the @JournalEntry[1KQ6rs5BfeNzaFrd]{Being a Gamemaster} journal is a great starting place to learn more about being a GM.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Hero</h2>
<p>This adventure is designed to be played by four 1st-level heroes, but it will work for two or three heroes with only a few slight adjustments. Each player should pick one of the @JournalEntry[1C5eYWxhXjCgQUOc]{Pregenerated Heroes}, or build their own hero following the steps in the @JournalEntry[KIpNnMtah73eyPC8]{Character Creation} handout.</p>
<p>If you are planning on running the game for Pathfinder Society organised play, you should also ensure that you have verified the information within the @JournalEntry[x76hH0AqjPcVnEKQ]{Pathfinder Society} handout.</p>
<p>Give the players 10-15 minutes to look over their character sheets so they can learn how their characters work. During this time, you should read through the introduction and @JournalEntry[dYY2HXUCuf523whn]{first encounter} to get ready to run it. If you have extra time, you might also want to read the @JournalEntry[5vvtOkNxnpzih0bO]{Combat Guide} or other rules in preparation.</p>
<h2>Using the Maps</h2>
<p>This adventure, like most published adventures, is presented as a series of areas to explore and challenges to face. Each one is tied to a location on the map of the dungeon and coded with a number. The dungeon in this adventure consists of two levels.</p>

<article>
<p>This module includes both Paizo's original maps as well as some Foundry-exclusive remakes which were designed by Narchy Maps for use with this adventure. You can choose whichever style you feel is right for your table.</p>
<p>The scenes provided in this module include descriptions for each room, pinned as Map Notes. You can ensure they are always visible by pressing the "Toggle Notes Display" button from the Journal Notes tool on the toolbar. For more information about map notes, please see the Map Notes article linked above.</p>
<p>To view a map ahead of time without showing it to your players, right click it and choose "view scene". This is a good time to place down your heroes' tokens near the entrance of @JournalEntry[dYY2HXUCuf523whn]{Room 01: Hungry Rats}- the point from which they'll begin their exploration of the dungeon. When you're ready for your players to join you on a scene, you'll right-click it again and this time, choose "activate". </p>
<p>All of the maps are fully walled and feature dynamic lighting which will reveal the map as the heroes explore it. It's OK if the players can't see the entire map- they won't know what's in each room until they enter it.</p>

<h2>Exploring the Dungeon</h2>
<p>As the game proceeds, the players explore the dungeon by moving their tokens around the map. The descriptions for each room are contained in journals which are pinned as Map Notes to the room on the scene- whenever the heroes enter a new area, refer to the pinned journal for a description of the room and any encounters it contains.</p>
<p>Each entry begins with a brief introduction so you know what to expect, followed by text set in green for you to read aloud. The rest of the area’s text includes all the information you need about what the heroes will come across in this area. This text contains spoilers for the room—it gives you information about the challenges the heroes face as they explore the area. If the area includes combat, traps, hazards, or treasure, the rules for those are in this text.</p>
<p>As they move through the dungeon levels, the players will use their heroes’ skills and abilities to explore the area and overcome its obstacles. It’s likely they’ll have questions and try actions that aren’t covered by the rules. As the GM, you get to make up the answers and decide what happens, but always try to be fair, and remember that the goal of the game is for everyone to have a fun time. You should encourage the heroes to try new things as they learn, but don’t forget that, as new adventurers, their heroes’ abilities are limited.</p>
<p>If the players get stuck or confused about what to do next, you can give them a few hints or ideas to get them started, like “Do you want to open the door?” or “Who wants to look for hidden treasure?” Remember that this is their first game, too, and they will have more fun if everyone is participating.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>When your players have chosen their heroes, you're ready to move on to the next step- setting up the adventure! The next handout, @JournalEntry[zH5TMivFVhFux4qH]{Setting the Scene}, has all the information you need to share before your players dive into the dungeon proper.</p>
