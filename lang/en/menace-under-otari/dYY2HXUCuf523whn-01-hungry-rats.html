<p>The first encounter happens in the basement of the Otari Fishery. The giant rats are already placed in the room for you, but currently, they're hidden. You'll reveal them when they attack, but for now, leave them hidden and read the following to the players:</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">The stairs leading into the basement of the Otari Fishery creak with age as you make your way downstairs to find the beast that has been eating all the fish. In the center of the room, between stone pillars holding up the fishery overhead, are barrels filled with salted fish. Two of these barrels have been smashed open, spilling their contents on the floor. In the east wall is a large hole, opening into darkness.<br />Just a few hours ago, you gathered with a few other adventurers in the office of Tamily Tanderveil, where she offered you ten gold pieces each if you could put an end to this menace. She was thrilled when you agreed to help her with this simple task, but as you make your way downstairs, you can't help but wonder if this might be a lot more adventure than you bargained for.</p>
<p>Go around the table and ask each player the first thing they want their hero to do in the room. As each player describes their action, allow them to move their token around this area, but don't let them leave the room just yet.</p>
<p>The shelves along the walls on the north and south sides of the room are piled high with general supplies that belong to the fishery. Heroes who investigate the hole in the wall on the east side of the room find piles of loose rock and dirt on the inside of the room. It looks like something has broken open the wall from the other side!</p>
<p>After each player has had a chance to do one thing, an ominous skittering noise comes from the hole in the wall- giant rats emerge to attack! Read the following to the players.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">A strange chittering comes from the hole in the wall. Suddenly, a massive rat the size of a dog emerges from the darkness—and it isn't alone! The giant rats rush toward you, their huge teeth snapping.</p>

<h3>Starting a Combat</h3>
<p>You'll need one giant rat for each player. When you're ready, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reveal the rat tokens on the map by selecting them, right-clicking on one, and clicking "Toggle Visibility State".</li>
<li>Select the tokens for the rats and the heroes by drag-selecting them all. Right-click one of them, and choose "Toggle Combat State"</li>
<li>Once they're added to the combat tracker, you can quickly roll initiative for all of the rats by choosing "Roll NPCs."</li>
<li>Your players may roll initiative by clicking the d20 icon next to their character in the combat tracker.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Popping Out a Sidebar Tab</h3>
<p>Once combat's begun, you'll need to keep an eye on the chat to see the results of rolls. Instead of needing to tab between the encounter tracker tab and the chat tab, you can pop the combat tracker out by double right-clicking on the tab's icon (the fist) on your sidebar. This will let you position it wherever you'd like without needing to split attention. In fact, you can do this to any tab, including the chat log itself!</p>

<p>In combat, each player takes turns and follows specific rules about what they can and can't do. See the @JournalEntry[5vvtOkNxnpzih0bO]{Encounters} journal for step-by-step instructions on how to handle combat.</p>

<article>
<p>The Giant rats' statistics can be viewed by clicking Giant Rats above.</p>
<p>On its turn, each rat moves toward a different hero and attacks. If a hero falls unconscious, the rat moves to the next nearest and attacks.</p>
<h3>Attacks</h3>
<p>When a creature uses the Strike action to make an attack, first pick a target within the reach (or range) of your weapon. Then, you can hover over a token and press 'T' on your keyboard to designate it as a target. You can also click the targeting button on the token menu. If you need to mark more than one target as a GM, you can select multiple tokens and press T, while as a player you can hold shift before pressing T while hovering each token you wish to target.</p>
<p>To attack using the Jaws of a Giant Rat, open the character sheet for the rat (by double-clicking on the Giant Rat Token) and click the "Strike (+7)" button in the Attacks section of the sheet listed below the Jaws attack. This will open a dialog box asking if there are any modifiers that need to be applied. Since we have none, simply click "Roll (+7)".</p>
<p>The system will compare your result to the target's AC automatically. It even takes into account things like flanking! This automation can save a lot of time for the GM, but it's always worth checking to make sure you didn't forget a modifier from something like cover.</p>
<p>If you roll a 20 on the die, or the total is at least 10 more than the target hero's Armor Class, you might roll a critical hit! These are marked in green in the chat card, and deal twice as much damage.</p>
<p>To roll damage, click the "Damage" button in the chat sidebar (or "Critical" if the attack was a critical hit). Once the damage appears in the chat log, you can select the token affected and click the appropriate button beneath the damage total to apply the appropriate damage value. </p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>For defeating the giant rats, give each hero 80 XP.</p>

<h2>After Combat</h2>
<p>Once one side is defeated or flees, you don't need to track actions anymore and heroes no longer need to act in order. Instead, go around the table and ask the players what the heroes would like to do next. If the heroes return to talk to Tamily, she’s relieved to learn that the rats are dead, but she is certain that rats couldn't have caused all of the destruction below. The heroes will have to explore further if they want to earn their reward. When the players decide to explore beyond this room, turn to @JournalEntry[d1dC4s6Cqck7BfyK]{02: Drop into Darkness}</p>
