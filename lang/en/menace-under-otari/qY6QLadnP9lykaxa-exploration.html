<p>As heroes move from place to place, exploring a dungeon, wilderness, or city, the game is flexible. If a fight breaks out during exploration, the game turns into an @JournalEntry[5vvtOkNxnpzih0bO]{Encounter}, which follows a more specific set of rules.</p>
<p>Exploration involves movement and roleplaying, and the GM determines the flow of time based on what the heroes do. Your hero might be traveling from one town to another, chatting with a couple of merchants at an outpost along the way, or having a terse conversation with the watchful city guards at your destination. If the GM needs to track how long travel takes, they'll use this table- the party travels at the speed of its slowest member.</p>
<table class="av-table">

<tr class="av-table-header">

<p>Between encounters, the heroes often explore dungeons or other environments. Time is more flexible during exploration than in encounters and is measured in 10-minute intervals or more. You tell the players what happens, and you can skip over any parts of their travels that aren’t interesting!</p>
<h2>Set a Party Order</h2>
<p>When the group starts exploring, let the players decide among themselves where in the group their heroes are while exploring. This order can determine who gets attacked first when enemies or traps threaten from various directions. It’s up to you to determine the specifics of who gets targeted based on the situation.</p>
<p>When an encounter starts, the group usually remains in the same general formation. With the heroes' input, decide their positions when you put the tokens on the scene. If they get the drop on their enemies or detect a hazard in advance, they can move around as they see fit before dealing with it.</p>
<h2>Exploration Activities</h2>
<p>While the party explores, each player who wants to do something beyond just traveling chooses an exploration activity for their character. Players usually choose from the default activities, but there’s no need for them to memorize the exploration activities and use them exactly. Instead, when your players want to do something in addition to simply traveling, have them describe the basics of what they're attempting to do, such as “I’m searching for hazards” or “I’m keeping my shield ready in case we’re attacked.” As the GM, you find the best exploration activity to match their description and describe the effects of that activity. Some exploration activities limit how fast a character can travel and be effective.</p>

<p>If a player wants to do something not on the list of exploration activities above, you can let them if they could reasonably do it while walking around. If the activity is similar to an action someone could use in an encounter, it usually consists of a single action repeated roughly 10 times per minute. You might find that a player wants to do something equivalent to spending 3 actions every 6 seconds (18 times per minute), just like they would in combat. However, heroes can’t maintain that level of exertion in exploration mode without getting exhausted. They can do so in combat only because combat lasts such a short time.</p>
<h3>Narrating Exploration</h3>
<p>As the group explores, describe the sights, sounds, and sensations. Encourage the other players to have their heroes truly explore, and reward their curiosity. The things they try to do in exploration mode show you what they’re interested in and what they consider important. As you play, you should get a good feel for what intrigues certain players, and you can add more of those things to your adventures or emphasize these points in published adventures.</p>
<p>Activities like Detect Magic, Investigate, and Search can tip off a player that something is odd about an area. But that doesn't mean they know exactly what it is! Instead, use these as a starting point for a roleplaying scene. For instance, if a character finds something magical with detect magic, the party likely still needs to stop and look at the surroundings in more detail to figure out what it is.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a character got a 22 on their Perception check to Search while traveling through an area containing a trap that needs a DC 20 to detect it, you should tell the player that their character noticed a trap in the area, and you can give a rough idea of the trap’s location and nature. The party needs to stop and examine the area more to learn specifics about the trap.</p>
<h1>Complications</h1>
<h2>Environments</h2>
<p>Exploration gets slower or harder when the party faces dense jungles, deep snow, sandstorms, extreme heat, or similar conditions. You decide how much these factors impact the heroes’ progress. Some examples can be found on the @JournalEntry[oiCmDc80T3El2rDj]{Environments} handout.</p>
<h2>Hazards</h2>
<p>Exploration can get broken up by traps and other @JournalEntry[TyXs3Gk0DQMSGotS]{Hazards}. Most hazards, like the @Actor[Z9ggO7spfHwr8up1]{Falling Ceiling}, pose a threat to the heroes only once and can be dealt with in exploration mode without needing to start an encounter. Heroes have a better chance to detect hazards while exploring if they use the Search exploration activity.</p>
<h2>Rolling Initiative</h2>
<p>An encounter starts with rolling for initiative, and you’re the one who calls for the roll! Players each roll for their characters, and you roll for their enemies. Call for the roll as soon as two opposing groups come into contact or when a creature on one side decides to take action against the other. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="Headers---Body_Body-Bullet">• A group of heroes are exploring a cavern. They enter a narrow passage patrolled by a group of hostile kobold warriors. Now that the two groups are in the same area, it’s time to roll initiative.</p>
<p class="Headers---Body_Body-Bullet">• Kyra, Valeros, and Ezren are negotiating with the kobold king while Merisiel sneaks up along a ledge. Things aren’t going well with the negotiation, so Merisiel launches a surprise attack from hiding. As soon as she says this is her plan, you call for initiative, letting Merisiel use Stealth for her initiative.</p>
<h3>Character Placement</h3>
<p>When calling for initiative for an encounter, you also need to decide where the participants in the encounter go on the battle map. Use the party’s traveling order as a starting point. You can move forward heroes who are using Stealth to get into position, placing them where they could reasonably have moved before they had a chance to be detected. Consult with each player to make sure their position makes sense to both of you.</p>
