<h3>Goods and Services</h3>
<p>Oloria Gallentine is a seventh-generation citizen of Otari and the owner of the fastest and most reliable delivery service in the area. Oloria can probably acquire anything the heroes need that they can’t find in Otari, although the price for such orders might be steep. Heroes in need of coin can also find opportunities at Gallentine Deliveries. Oloria has a regular need for reliable couriers, and she’ll pay heroes who seem trustworthy to deliver dangerous cargo to unusual locations.</p>
