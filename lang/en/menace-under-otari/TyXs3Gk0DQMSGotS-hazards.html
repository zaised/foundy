<p>Dungeons are rife with devious traps meant to protect the treasures within, ranging from devices that shoot darts to those that drop heavy blocks or expose hidden pit traps.</p>
<h1>Detecting a Hazard</h1>
<p>Every hazard has a trigger of some kind, like a trip wire or a pressure plate. When characters approach a hazard, they have a chance of finding the mechanism before triggering the hazard. During exploration, determine whether the party detects a hazard when the heroes first enter the area in which it appears. Only someone actively searching (using the Search activity while exploring or the Seek action in an encounter) has a chance to notice them. Anyone who succeeds becomes aware of the hazard, and you can describe what they notice.</p>
<h1>Triggering a Hazard</h1>
<p>If the group fails to detect a hazard and the hazard’s trigger depends on a standard part of traveling (such as stepping on a floor plate), the hazard’s reaction occurs. Hazards that would be triggered only when someone directly manipulates the environment—by opening a door, for example—use their reactions only if a hero explicitly takes that action.</p>
<h1>Disabling a Hazard</h1>
<p>The most versatile method for deactivating traps is the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill. The DC is listed in the hazard’s stat block. As noted in skills, a creature must be trained in Thievery to use the Disable a Device action. Fully disarming some traps requires multiple successful Disable a Device actions. For example, disabling scythe blades requires a successful check on each of two blades. A critical failure on any roll to disable a hazard triggers it.</p>
<p>A character must first detect a hazard (or have it pointed out to them) to try to deactivate it. They can attempt to deactivate a hazard whether or not it has already been triggered, though most hazards no longer pose a danger once their reactions have occurred.</p>
<h2>Damaging a Hazard</h2>
<p>Damaging a trap works like damaging a shield: the trap reduces the damage it takes by its Hardness. If a hazard’s Hit Points are reduced to its Broken Threshold (BT) or lower, the hazard becomes broken and can no longer be activated. If it’s reduced to 0 HP, it’s destroyed and can’t be repaired. Usually, the trap is triggered when attacked, though it isn’t triggered if it’s destroyed in one hit because there’s not enough left to harm anyone! If it’s broken in one hit but not destroyed, you decide whether it triggers based on the type of trap.</p>
<p>Hazards’ AC, saving throws, Hardness, HP, and BT are listed in their stat blocks. A hazard that doesn’t list one of these statistics can’t be affected by anything targeting that statistic. For example, a hazard that has HP but no BT can’t be broken, but it can still be destroyed. Hazards can be targeted only by things that specifically say they can target objects. Certain abilities like bleed damage, poison, mental effects, and the sickened condition don’t work against a hazard, nor do any other effects that wouldn’t reasonably work on an object.</p>
<h1>Hazard Experience</h1>
<p>Characters gain XP for overcoming a hazard, whether they disable it, avoid it, or simply endure its attacks. If they trigger the same hazard later on, they don’t gain XP for the hazard again. The XP a hazard gives depends on the party’s level, as shown below. For example, a 0-level hazard faced by a 1st-level party is worth 6 XP because level 0 is the party’s level -1.</p>
