<p>When the heroes return home or otherwise aren’t adventuring, they’re in downtime. This is their time to do everyday activities, such as buying gear. You might not have any downtime in your games at all! If the heroes do have some time off between adventures, just ask the players to spend a few minutes describing what their heroes do in that time. You probably won’t need to roleplay any scenes. Downtime is a bigger focus of the full Pathfinder game since the choices the heroes make carry across all 20 levels of play.</p>
<p>Two things heroes can likely do during downtime are shop for magic items and @JournalEntry[YtLflW4aY6KxtFWs]{Rest} long enough to recover from ailments. A hero who does nothing but rest for a full 24-hour period recovers Hit Points equal to double their Constitution instead of the normal amount from an 8-hour rest. Heroes above 1st level multiply this amount by their level.</p>
