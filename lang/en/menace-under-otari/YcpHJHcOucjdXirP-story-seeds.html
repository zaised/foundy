<p>The heroes might end up spending some time in Otari, and adventures can happen in town just as easily as in a dungeon or the wilderness. Here are possible encounters and seeds for larger stories.</p>
<h3>A Bad Day at the Market</h3>
<p>Laborers laying the foundation for an expansion to the Otari Market unearth a nest of giant centipedes that spill into the market stalls and must be exterminated. The centipedes' lair connects to a disused sewer system, where a group of goblins are planning a sneaky raid on the market. If the heroes act quickly, they can catch the goblin thieves by surprise.</p>
<h3>The Fire God</h3>
<p>An arsonist captured by the Otari Guard insists that her crimes were commanded by a divine being she met in the ruins of a building that had burned down year earlier. The building contains a hell hound, cinder rats, and a creature of shimmering fire who claims to be a god. This “god” is the malevolent ghost of an actor who died in the earlier fire and hopes to deceive the living.</p>
<h3>Grim Harvest</h3>
<p>Two acolytes from the Dawnflower Library are acting suspiciously, opening the graves in the Otari Graveyard they’re supposed to be tending. Investigation shows the acolytes have been murdered and replaced by doppelgangers. They’ve been exhuming the graves to feed a gluttonous band of ghouls, who lair within a mausoleum the doppelgangers have filled with traps and other dangers. If the heroes defeat the ghouls, they recover a strange idol the ghouls used to command the doppelgangers; the heroes can then use the idol to discover who else in town has been replaced.</p>

<h3>Honor of Thieves</h3>
<p>At Crook’s Nook, a brine shark elemental leaps right into the tavern from one of the trapdoors. The heroes are on hand to defeat it, earning the gratitude of the Osprey Club. The thieves decide to thank the heroes by committing minor crimes against the heroes’ rivals (or anyone they perceive to be the heroes’ rivals) and give the heroes the “credit.” These gestures undoubtedly land the heroes in trouble with Lardus Longsaddle, and the heroes must clear up the confusion.</p>
<h3>Under the Thirsty Alpaca</h3>
<p>The Thirsty Alpaca’s collapse was inadvertently caused by a tribe of kobolds digging out tunnels beneath it while seeking treasures they believed were still hidden there. Their biggest mistake was allying with a gang of pugwampi gremlins, whose ill luck caused the collapse. The surviving kobolds try to keep townspeople away from the ruins with their spooky tricks and traps. The kobolds seek to re-excavate the passages and also fight against the surviving gremlins, who have decided to betray them! The PCs could try to negotiate a truce, evict both the kobolds and the gremlins, or find another solution.</p>
<h3>Wrin's Surprise Gift</h3>
<p>While meeting with the heroes, Wrin Sivinxi receives a large, unlabeled package. She opens it to reveal animated armor that runs amok. After the heroes stop it, Wrin asks them to track down the person who shipped it. Their investigation leads to a ship at the harbor, where an old enemy of Wrin’s is hiding out with her hobgoblin warrior bodyguards.</p>

<h1>More Adventures in Otari</h1>
<p>The adventure in this book and the story seeds above aren’t the only adventures this town offers. The standalone Pathfinder Adventure Troubles in Otari continues the story begun here and brings heroes all the way to 5th level. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path is a separate series of three linked adventures, starting with Ruins of Gauntlight, set in Otari and a dangerous dungeon just to the north. Of course, you can also invent adventures of your own!</p>
