<p>Creatures range from the mundane to the extraordinary, from dragons to wolves. While they’re most often opponents in combat, creatures can provide interesting situations outside of encounters.</p>
<h1>Reading Creature Statistics</h1>
<p>Each creature’s rules appear in a stat block. Below is an example stat block that explains how to read one. The top of a creature’s stat block lists its name and its level. While heroes start at 1st level, some weak creatures can be level 0 or even level -1. Underneath this heading is the creature’s traits line. The first entry is the creature’s alignment, given as an abbreviation (L is lawful, C is chaotic, G is good, E is evil, and N is neutral). Next is the creature’s size. The creature’s other traits are then listed alphabetically. The stat block also lists all the actions and abilities the creature can use other than the basic actions available to every creature. Action icons note how many actions an ability requires.</p>
<h1>Creature Size</h1>
<p>Creatures can be Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large. Medium creatures, like the heroes, take up one square on a grid, as do Small creatures. Up to four Tiny creatures can fit in one square, and a Tiny creature can share a square with a Small or larger creature. Large creatures take up a 2 × 2 area.</p>
<h1>Identifying Creatures</h1>
<p>The Recall Knowledge action can be used to identify a creature. The DC is based on the creature’s level.</p>
<p>The skill used depends on that creature’s most important trait, as shown below. A hero who identifies a creature learns one of its abilities—such as a troll’s regeneration. On a critical success, the hero also learns a second detail that’s less commonly known, like the trigger for the creature’s reaction.</p>
