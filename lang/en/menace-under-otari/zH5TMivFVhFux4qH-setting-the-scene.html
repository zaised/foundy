<p>Once each player has chosen their hero and everyone is ready to play, it’s time to begin the game. Make sure that the tokens for each hero are placed by the stairway at the bottom of floor 1, next to @JournalEntry[dYY2HXUCuf523whn]{Area 01}.</p>
<p>Once everyone is ready to begin, start by reading the text in green below to set the scene.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative" style="margin-bottom:25px">The small seaside town of Otari is known for its fresh fish and skilled sailors, but above all, it’s a big logging town, providing valuable wood to the nearby metropolis of Absalom. But for you, Otari is home. You grew up playing on the docks, getting lost in the nearby woods, and hearing the fantastical stories of travelers from faraway lands, tales of terrifying dragons and virtuous knights. Such adventure always seemed so distant- until today.<br />Word has begun to spread around Otari that there's a problem down at the Otari Fishery. Some are saying that some sort of beast is lurking in the basement, feeding on the stores of salted fish. Folks are worried that whatever is eating the fish might get hungry enough to eat the fishers next!<br />You've received a letter from Tamily Tanderveil, the owner of the Fishery. Inside is a desperate plea for help. With the town guard busy protecting the loggers, she needs a few brave souls to venture down into the basement of her warehouse and put an end to the beast that's feasting on her fish! Do you have the courage to face the menace under Otari?</p>

<p>As you read the above text, you might want to show your players a picture of Tamily so they can see who’s asking them to take on this task.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that's very easy! Each major location and NPC in Otari has a dedicated handout describing their place of business and personality. As well as advice on how to portray Tamily, the @JournalEntry[f1HTHkFXB6oa1xcS]{Otari Fishery} handout includes a picture of her. To show it to your players, you need only open it, click on "image" in the header, and then "show players". If you'd like to show the players the art vignette rather than just her portrait, you can instead show them the @JournalEntry[STNCfDV2B8XYQsmv]{Tamily Has a Job For You} handout in the same way. </p>

<p>After you finish reading, have the players introduce their heroes to one another, including their name, ancestry, background, and class. Players might also want to describe what their hero looks like, what kind of gear they carry, and maybe a bit about their personality.</p>
<p>After the introductions, make sure the player tokens are on the stairs leading down into the basement in Area 1. The order is up to them to decide, but it's smart to put characters with more Hit Points or a higher Armor Class in front. Make sure that one character is at the bottom of the stairs, then activate the scene and move on to the journal entry for @JournalEntry[dYY2HXUCuf523whn]{Area 01}.</p>
