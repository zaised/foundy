<p>As you go on adventures, defeat opponents, and solve challenges, your character will gain Experience Points (XP). Keep track of your XP on your character sheet as you earn it.</p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve reached 1,000 XP, you gain a level! Increase your level by 1 and subtract 1,000 XP from your current XP. (You get to keep any extra XP toward your next level!) Then consult your class entry to learn all the benefits you gained from leveling up.</p>

<h3>Increasing your level</h3>
<p>When you level up, first, increase your level on your character sheet. The Pathfinder Second Edition system for Foundry will automatically add several features and abilities for you based on your class. This list isn't definitive, and it can't make choices like skill increases or feats for you, but it should help save you some time!</p>
<h3>Making Choices</h3>
<p>If you navigate to your feats tab, you should see that some slots have appeared. For instance, if you level to 2, you will see a slot for your level 2 class feat appear. These feat slots can be helpful for communicating where and when you have to make a choice. To fill them, you can use the Compendium Browser to choose between the feats that are available for your class and level, as explained in the @JournalEntry[KIpNnMtah73eyPC8]{Creating Your Hero} journal entry linked above. Once you've made your choice, just drag it from the Compendium Browser into your empty feat slot.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also use the Compendium Browser to choose new spells, or find any other features which weren't automatically added to your sheet.</p>
