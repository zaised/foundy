<p>If you make an attack and it hits, or if you successfully cast a spell to harm your foe, you’ll roll dice to determine how much you hurt an enemy. Roll the kind and number of dice indicated by your weapon or spell, and add any numbers listed for that ability (for example, many weapons say to add your Strength to the damage for melee Strikes).</p>
<p>The damage you deal has a type, such as piercing or fire, which can matter since some creatures take more or less damage depending on the type.</p>
<p>Damage you deal decreases the target’s Hit Points by the same amount, so a creature that takes 6 damage loses 6 Hit Points. If penalties to an attack would reduce its damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage. For example, if you threw a dagger and rolled a 1 on the damage roll while you had a –1 penalty to damage rolls, you still deal 1 damage to your target.</p>
<h2>Doubling and Halving</h2>
<p>You might need to double or halve your damage, depending on the action you used. For instance, many spells deal half damage if your enemy succeeds at its save, full damage if it fails, and double damage if it critically fails. You double or halve the damage after rolling rather than changing the number of dice you roll. Add any bonuses or penalties before you double or halve. Special damage—like the extra damage from a rogue’s sneak attack—is doubled or halved, too. If you halve damage that’s an odd number, round down.</p>
<h2>Persistent Damage</h2>
<p>Persistent damage, like bleeding or being on fire, hurts you over time. When you gain persistent damage, you don’t take it right away. Instead, you take it at the end of your turn each round. After you take the damage, you attempt a DC 15 flat check (roll a 15 or higher on a d20 without adding anything) to see if you recover from the persistent damage.</p>
<h2>Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances</h2>
<p>Damage might affect a creature differently if it has an immunity, weakness, or resistance to that damage type. Immunity prevents the creature from taking any damage at all. A weakness causes the creature to increase damage they take by the listed amount, and resistance prevents the listed amount of damage. So if you used a spell that deals 10 fire damage, a creature that’s immune to fire would take no damage, a creature with weakness 5 to fire would lose 15 Hit Points, and a creature with resistance 5 to fire would lose 5 Hit Points. This adjustment applies to every instance of damage, so if you made three Strikes that deal bludgeoning damage against a creature with resistance 5 to bludgeoning damage, it would take 5 less damage from each of the three strikes! Usually, heroes don’t have immunities or weaknesses, though the resist energy wizard spell can give resistance to some damage types.</p>
<p>Immunity matters for more than just damage. A creature that’s immune to a certain trait is completely unaffected by anything with that trait, and one with immunity to a condition can’t gain that condition. For instance, a creature without a mind lists “mental” in its immunities. Not only would it take no mental damage, but a spell with the mental trait wouldn’t do anything to it at all! In some cases, a creature is immune to part of an attack or spell but not the rest, and the GM determines whether this is the case. For instance, if you hit a monster that’s immune to fire with a flaming sword, the sword itself would still deal slashing damage, but the extra fire damage wouldn’t do anything.</p>
<h2>Damaging Items</h2>
<p>The rules for attacking and damaging items differ from the rules for creatures. Attacks and spells don’t normally damage items, except for traps, unless specified otherwise. If you have a shield, it can take damage if you use the Shield Block reaction.</p>

<h2>Applying Damage in Foundry</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>Beneath any damage roll in chat, you'll see a row of buttons that allow you to easily apply damage to selected tokens. While you have a token selected, pressing the "<strong>damage</strong>", "<strong>double</strong>", or "<strong>half</strong>" buttons will apply that much damage. There's also "<strong>heal</strong>", which instead restores that many hit points. If your character is using a shield, and you would like to block a hit, then you can toggle the "<strong>block</strong>" button on before doing this to subtract the appropriate amount of damage.</p>
<p>This helpful timesaving feature is widely useful, but it does have limitations. Currently, the system does not automate damage resistances, weaknesses, or immunities- if your heroes or the NPCs they are facing have such abilities, you may need to adjust the damage taken.</p>
