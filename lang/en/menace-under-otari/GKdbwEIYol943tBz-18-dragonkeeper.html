<h2>Level Up</h2>
<p>If the heroes overcame all of the challenges through Area 17, they should have enough XP to gain a level! Going up to 2nd level gives each hero the boost of power they'll need to face the final two encounters against the kobold boss and the dragon! You might also encourage the party to rest at this point.</p>
<p>You can help the players level up their heroes by sharing with them the journal entry. Open the @JournalEntry[JL2af7XedJGFvfbc]{Leveling Up} handout, and click on "Show Players" in the header.</p>
<h3>A Hard Fight</h3>
<p>This might be a very tough fight for the heroes, especially if they haven't reached level 2 yet. If they're forced to retreat, Zolgran doesn't follow them, but she orders her guards to do so. If the heroes slay these guards but still retreat, Zolgran recruits two @Actor[r9w1n85mp9Ip4QiS]{Kobold Warriors} to serve as her new guards for the next time the heroes arrive. They aren't as powerful as kobold scouts, but they still help defend their boss.</p>

<p>The kobolds' boss lives in this chamber, accompanied by two kobold scouts. Place the boss on the throne, and put the two scouts at the bottom of the stairs. When the heroes enter the room, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">A gaping pit opens in the floor in the center of this large, natural chamber. On the far side, a ledge overlooks the entry. Atop this ledge is an ornate stone throne that looks entirely out of place for this room. A regal kobold wearing an oversized crown made of fish bones sits atop the throne. “Kill the intruders!” she snarls at the two kobold guards at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>Things have been rough for the band over the past few years, but their fortune changed when they got the chance to steal a dragon’s egg! With the precious treasure spirited away to the kobold hideout, the boss, Zolgran, has devised grand plans for her band now that it has a dragon patron. After raising the dragon, she hopes to use the beast to subjugate the entire region and finally reclaim the town of Otari for her people. Fortunately for the citizens of Otari, the baby dragon isn't fully grown yet—but the new hatchling is always hungry. That's why the band moved into these caverns, and why they've been raiding the Otari Fishery. Without a steady supply of food, the young dragon might turn to having kobolds for a snack!</p>

<h2>Encounter</h2>
<p>@Actor[AleeS0IRqT4tUphB]{Zolgran, the Kobold Boss}, @Actor[rPaHIh0ICnTLnRO6]{2 Kobold Scouts}</p>
</header>
<article>
<h3>The Pit</h3>
<p>This pit in the center of this chamber is 20 feet deep. Heroes attempting to leap across the pit must spend 2 actions and attempt a @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|showDC:all]{Athletics skill check}. If they fail, they fall down into the pit, taking 10 damage. A hero in the pit has to climb out, which requires them to succeed at two @Check[type:athletics|dc:10|showDC:all]{Athletics skill check} in a row.</p>
<h3>Kobold Tactics</h3>
<p>The dragon isn't yet tame enough to do the boss's bidding, so the kobolds have kept the creature in a nearby cave (@JournalEntry[f4U9FH1iaDGUZjvu]{Area 19}), safely tucked away from rest of the band. Unfortunately for the heroes, the boss and her guards are more than dangerous enough on their own.</p>
<p>The two kobold scouts move to either side of the pit to block the heroes from getting to their boss, but they chase any hero who manages to get past them. Meanwhile, Zolgran assaults the groups using spells! The crafty kobold can cast spells just like a wizard. The spells she has prepared are listed in her stat block.</p>
<p>On her first turn, she spends all 3 actions to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]{Magic Missile}. This spell fires three missiles, which she aims at the closest three heroes to deal 1d4+1 force damage each. If anyone gets past her guards, she casts @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4koZzrnMXhhosn0D]{Fear} on that hero, hoping to make them run away. If she runs out of 1st-level spells to cast, she casts @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gYjPm7YwGtEa1oxh]{Ray of Frost}. Zolgran attacks with her staff only if she runs out of other options.</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>If the heroes defeat Zolgran and her guards, award each hero 100 XP. If the heroes are still level 1 when they defeat this encounter, they each gain a bonus of 40 XP due to the additional challenge.</p>

<h2>Zolgran's Treasure</h2>
<p>@Actor[p84EOttaNannSP3y]{Zolgran's Treasure}</p>

<article>
<p>The ledge the throne sits on also serves as Zolgran's personal resting area. A straw pallet rests here, like those in @JournalEntry[4re1eriShy04xSlB]{Area 17}. Heroes who examine the out-of-place throne can match its design to the decor of @JournalEntry[73RoOAzThOUOCmbg]{Area 11} on the floor above, which is where the kobolds took it from. Most importantly, there's an old, rusty iron chest. Atop this chest is a large, broken eggshell that's almost 2 feet tall. Ivory in color, the shell has green veins running through it, and it’s clear that the pieces of eggshell worn by the boss and many of the kobolds here came from this egg. Although it’s still not entirely clear what was inside, there are large claw marks, bigger than any kobold could make, down one side of the shell.</p>
<figure class="left"><img class="noborder" src="modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-items/smoking-sword.webp" height="280" /></figure>
<h3>Inside the Chest</h3>
<p>The chest is locked, but Zolgran has the key tied at her waist. If the heroes don’t find the key, a character with a set of thieves' tools can attempt a @Check[type:thievery|dc:25]{Thievery skill check}, and the lock opens on a success! If the players manage to open the chest, reveal the loot actor to them on the map.</p>
<p>Inside the chest are some of the more interesting treasure that the kobolds found during their exploration of these tunnels. The treasure includes a silver bracelet with a fish pattern worth 5 gp, a very old map that depicts some strange-looking dungeon, a <em>smoking sword</em> with a dwarven face carved into the hilt, a wand of <em>heal</em>, 2 <em>healing potions</em>, and a <em>hat of disguise</em>.</p>

<h2>Are we Done?</h2>
<p>If the PCs defeat the kobolds and their boss, they might return to the Otari Fishery. If they decide not to explore any further, the adventure can easily end here. Tamily happily pays the heroes for completing the job, even if she does wonder what was in that mighty egg. She's also curious as to what happened to all the fish, as the kobolds couldn’t possibly have eaten it all, but such mysteries will have to wait for another day.</p>
<aside class="bb-float-block">
<h3>Audio Cue</h3>
<p>If your players decide to press on, you can use the Dragon Soundboard effects "Wyrmling Growl Distant" to warn them of the imminent danger of continuing before they have prepared. </p>
</aside>
<p>In this case—or if the heroes don’t end up fleeing from the next encounter—the young dragon in the kobolds' care survives! Eventually the dragon leaves the cave and starts hunting in the countryside, becoming a menace for years to come. Fortunately, dragons grow in power very slowly. The heroes might find themselves chasing down this beast in the future! If they’ve gained a few more levels, they’ll have an edge in the fight.</p>
<p>More likely, though, the players might push on to explore the next cavern—@JournalEntry[f4U9FH1iaDGUZjvu]{Area 19}. That encounter is the most dangerous fight of the entire adventure, so feel free to encourage the heroes to rest if they’re out of limited resources, such as spells.</p>
