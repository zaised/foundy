<p>As the GM, you're responsible for resolving any questions or disputes about the rules. Remember that keeping your game moving is more important than being 100% correct. Looking up rules at the table can slow the game down, so in many cases, it's better to make your best guess rather than scour the book for the exact rule. To make calls on the fly, use the following guidelines.</p>
<p>• If you don't know how long a quick task takes, go with 1 action, or 2 actions if a character shouldn't be able to perform it three times per round.</p>
<p>• If you're not sure what action a task uses, look for the most similar basic action.</p>
<p>• When two sides are opposed, have one roll against the other's DC. Don't have both sides roll (initiative is the exception to this rule). The character who should roll is the one acting, except in the case of saving throws.</p>
<p>• If something a character does raises or lowers the chances of success, grant a +1 circumstance bonus or a -1 circumstance penalty.</p>
<p>• If you don't know what check to use for something a hero is attempting, pick the most appropriate skill.</p>
<p>• When a hero accomplishes something noteworthy that doesn't have already give XP, award them XP for a minor or moderate accomplishment (10 to 30 XP).</p>
<p>• When the heroes fail at a task, look for a way they might fail forward, meaning the story moves forward with a negative consequence rather than the failure halting progress entirely.</p>
