<p>You’ll make an attack roll when you Strike and for some other actions. For most attack rolls, you’ll compare your result against your target’s Armor Class (AC). There are three main types of attack rolls: melee attack rolls, ranged attack rolls, and spell attack rolls. Some skills can be used to make attacks, such as Athletics being used to Grapple someone rather than damage them.</p>
<h2>Multiple Attack Penalty</h2>
<p>If you attack more than once on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty. This penalty is -5 for your second attack, and -10 for your third and any subsequent attacks. Some abilities or features, such as a weapon's agile trait, reduce your Multiple Attack Penalty.</p>
<p>Always calculate your multiple attack penalty for the weapon you’re using on that attack. If you attack with a longsword, then a shortsword (which has the agile trait), the attack with the shortsword is at –4, even though your first attack was with a weapon that isn’t agile.</p>
<p>The penalty resets every turn. It also applies only during your turn, so you don’t have to keep track of it if you can perform an Attack of Opportunity or a similar reaction that lets you make a Strike on someone else’s turn.</p>
<h2>Range Penalty</h2>
<p>Ranged and thrown weapons are less accurate against targets farther away. The weapon’s range increment determines this interval. As long as your target is at or within the listed range increment, also called the first range increment, you take no penalty to the attack roll. Beyond that distance, you take a –2 penalty for each additional increment beyond the first. Both the multiple attack penalty and range penalty can apply to the same attack, giving a big penalty to your second or third attack against someone far away!</p>
<h2>Light and Darkness</h2>
<p>There are three levels of light: bright light, dim light, and darkness. The game’s rules assume you’re in bright light, so most of the time you don’t have to worry about any special rules. Areas in shadow or lit by weak light sources are in dim light. Creatures and objects in dim light have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition, meaning any attack or other effect that would target them fails unless the creature trying to target them succeeds at a DC 5 flat check (rolling a 5 or higher on a d20 without adding anything).</p>
<p>A creature with darkvision or low-light vision can see in the dim light and targets creatures in it normally. Areas without any light at all are in darkness. A creature or object in darkness can’t be seen unless the creature looking for it has darkvision. A creature without darkvision or another means of perceiving in darkness is blinded while in darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond the darkness. When you’re blinded, all terrain is difficult terrain and you take a –4 status penalty to Perception checks that rely on sight. If you try to attack or affect a target you can’t see due to darkness or for any other reason, you fail unless you succeed at a DC 11 flat check.</p>

<h2>Rules-Based Lighting</h2>

<p>Foundry VTT supports dynamic lighting, which means that tokens can carry light sources around with them as they move. Moreover, the Pathfinder Second Edition system integrates this lighting system with the rules, appropriately upgrading lighting levels based on a character's senses so long as you have "rules-based vision" enabled under "automation" in your system settings. </p>
<p>Please note: While the Pathfinder Second Edition system provides rules-based lighting automations, it does not automatically apply penalties for differences in levels of illumination.</p>

<h1>Cover</h1>
<p>When you’re behind an obstacle that could block weapons, guard you against explosions, and make you harder to detect, you’re behind cover. Standard cover gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, to Reflex saves against area effects, and to Stealth checks to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise avoid detection.</p>
<p>Creatures give lesser cover, which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. A creature with standard cover can attempt to use the Stealth skill to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide}, but lesser cover isn’t sufficient for using Stealth.</p>
<p>You might simultaneously have cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you typically can’t target it at all. The GM decides whether you have cover and whether it’s lesser or standard.</p>
<h1>Flanking</h1>
<p>If you and an ally are on opposite sides or corners of an enemy, you’re flanking that enemy. This gives the creature the flat-footed condition (giving it a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) against attacks from anyone flanking it. If you stop flanking the creature, the flat-footed condition ends.</p>
<p>You can flank or help an ally flank only if you meet all three of the following conditions:</p>
<p>• No condition or effect is preventing you from acting or attacking.</p>
<p>• You’re holding melee weapons or able to make a fist attack.</p>
<p>• You’re close enough to reach the enemy with an attack.</p>

<h2>Automated Flanking</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>The Pathfinder Second Edition game system includes automation of flanking and appropriately enables flanking bonuses for cases where they would apply, removing the need to keep track of it yourself.</p>
<p>A simple way of understanding how this automation works is to consider that there are two "teams", Tokens linked to actors that are owned by players, and tokens whose actors are not. If you have not assigned ownership of an actor to a player account, it will not be counted for the benefits of flanking.</p>

<h1>Targets</h1>
<p>Some actions have you select one or more specific targets. You can’t select a target if it’s out of range, if you can’t tell where it is, if it doesn’t match restrictions on who you can target, or if some other ability prevents it from being targeted.</p>
<p>Some effects target an ally. This must be someone on your side, often another hero, but it might be a bystander you’re trying to protect. You aren’t your own ally. If it isn’t clear, the GM decides who counts as an ally or an enemy. An ability that targets a willing creature doesn’t do anything unless the target allows you to affect them. Only you can decide whether your hero is willing, and the GM decides whether an NPC is willing.</p>
<p>Melee attacks can target someone only if they’re adjacent—right next to the attacker on the grid. Being next to them diagonally on the corner of their space is still adjacent. Some abilities, like the Lunge fighter feat or the enlarge spell, let someone reach creatures further away. Large creatures can always reach creatures up to 10 feet away.</p>

<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop provides a simple approach to indicating which enemy or ally a player or GM may be targeting. You can quickly mark your targets by hovering the mouse over a token and pressing <strong>'T'</strong> on your keyboard. To target multiple tokens, a player can hold <strong>shift</strong> while pressing T. This provides a small colored indicated which matches the color a player has been assigned, and makes it easy to see who's targeting what.</p>
<p>The Pathfinder Second Edition game system also automates a number of options, such as comparing AC to see if your attack should hit, or providing for conditional bonuses such as Sneak Attacks. These automations only function if you have an enemy targeted when you perform your action.</p>
