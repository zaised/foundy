<p>This intersection offers the heroes a choice of which way theyâ€™d like to go first.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">Beyond the barricade, the passageway meanders briefly. The floor descends slightly and soon becomes flooded by a shallow pool of water. The water appears to be flowing out of a passageway to the right, and a shimmering blue light in that direction reflects off of the water there. The main passageway continues to the left, over the slight depression in the floor where the water has pooled. An overpowering stench drifts from around a bend.</p>
<p>The light coming from @JournalEntry[X3d3lzoGP2TbWjpV]{Area 14} shimmers and fades, as if it were a reflection off the water. If the players stop to study it for a while, they notice faint glimmers of firelight in the reflections, but these seem further away. Heroes who stop to listen here also note a faint growling noise coming from further up the main passageway- @JournalEntry[IUExNAepG68GUUhS]{Area 15}.</p>
