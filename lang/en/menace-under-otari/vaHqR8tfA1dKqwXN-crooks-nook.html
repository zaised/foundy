<p class="box-text narrative first">A sailors' tavern built as a bridge across the Osprey River.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>The lanky and shrewd Yanyismera owns Crook’s Nook, making her one of the town’s most prominent business owners. The fact that she’s also the head of the Osprey Club, Otari’s thieves’ guild, only increases her influence. She’s loyal to her town and rarely permits her thieves to target locals, although outsiders are fair targets for con games or robberies. Heroes unafraid to step outside the law eventually come to Yanyismera’s attention, and she might arrange illicit smuggling jobs or daring raids on visiting ships. @JournalEntry[pmFJX9jmX3hpOsXM]{Rogues} from Otari might know Yanyismera or might even currently be in her employ!</p>
<h3>Gathering Places</h3>
<p>Crook’s Nook serves several purposes in town—the large wooden structure functions as a bridge over the Osprey River, as a cheap place to get a room for the night, and as a tavern well known for serving the best seafood in town. Trapdoors in the tavern’s floor allow direct access to the river below for fishing, but foolhardy (or inebriated) patrons sometimes wrestle over these openings to determine who’s stronger and who’s getting wet. The building’s attic serves as the guildhall for Otari’s thieves’ guild, the Osprey Club—a function that’s perhaps the town’s worst-kept secret, as evidenced by the building’s very name.</p>
