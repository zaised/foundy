<p>The standard form of currency in Pathfinder is coinage, which comes in three types: copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), and gold pieces (gp). A silver piece is worth 10 cp and is the standard for most everyday transactions. Gold pieces are often used for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as 1 gold piece is worth 10 sp or 100 cp.</p>
<h2>Buying and Selling</h2>
<p>As you gain experience and additional wealth, you should periodically buy new equipment. You might also find equipment or even magic items during your adventures, or you can buy them once you have enough money. You can usually buy equipment only in settlements; the GM will let you know when it’s time for a shopping spree!</p>
<p>You can also sell equipment you aren’t using anymore. Most items can be sold for half their Price, but broken shields can’t be sold at all.</p>
