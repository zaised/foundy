<p class="box-text narrative first">Dwarves are well-known as a stoic and stern people who dwell deep underground in cities built into the hearts of the mightiest mountains. They are fierce on the battlefield, holding the line against charging orcs or taking the fight to towering giants. Dwarves stand about a foot shorter than most humans, and most take pride in braiding or styling their hair.</p>
