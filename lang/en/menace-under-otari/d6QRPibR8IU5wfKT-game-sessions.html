<p>You play out an adventure over a series of sessions, which usually last several hours and involve multiple encounters and some exploration. Each session can noticeably differ from the last. Think of a session as an episode of a TV show—  it should include some twists, turns, and changes so that the players are excited about what comes next.</p>

<h3>Planning a Session</h3>
<p>Often, the responsibility of scheduling the game falls on you as the GM since you have to prepare the game between sessions. Choose a time everyone can attend and a place to gather, whether it's around the kitchen table or in an online space. Many games have a set schedule, such as once per week, once every 2 weeks, or once per month. (Your first game might not be so predictable, though!) The less frequently your group meets, the better notes and recaps you'll need to keep everyone on the same page. If another player wants to take session notes, that's great too, especially if they set up a shared document everyone can reference online.</p>
<p>Plan a time for everybody to arrive, and also try to set a time when playing the game will begin. Having this planned can make it easier for everyone to finish catching up so you can start playing the game. Having an end time in mind is also important. A typical game session lasts about 4 hours. Less than 2 hours usually isn't enough time to get much done.</p>

<h3>Starting a Session</h3>
<p>Once everyone is ready to play, get everyone's attention and cover the following topics. These are in a rough order that you can change based on your group's style or a session's needs.</p>
<p>• Recap what happened during the previous sessions (if this isn't the first session).</p>
<p>• Establish where the heroes are at the beginning of this session. Have they been resting since their last challenge? Did you leave off with them in a hallway, preparing to raid the next room of a dungeon? Tell players whether their heroes had time to rest or recover since the last session.</p>
<p>• Establish goals. Repeat any goals the group already had, then let the players weigh in on whether these goals still apply and on whether there's anything else they hope to accomplish during the session.</p>
<p>• Commence adventuring! Usually the first thing you'll do in a session is describe the environment and sensations that surround the heroes, allowing them to react in the moment.</p>

<h3>Running a Session</h3>
<p>During a session, you're in charge of keeping the game's action moving, answering questions, and making rules decisions. You'll also want to keep a rough eye on the time, so you can end when it's most convenient for the group.</p>
<p>You're the one who customizes the rules you need from the imagined world you and the other players share. It's up to you to establish what's true in the world, but you have help in doing so! You're informed by the setting's backstory, your preparations, and the suggestions the other players make. You can adjust things on the fly from what you planned, too. You might have an idea in your notes that changes when a player does something unexpected.</p>
<p>You'll determine when heroes and foes need to attempt checks as well as what happens as a result of their rolls, which comes up most often during exploration. In an encounter, a player can usually determine their own hero's turn with you chiming in only to say whether an attack hits or if something in the environment requires a hero to attempt a check.</p>
<h3>The Spotlight</h3>
<p>As you run the game, keep track of which player has the spotlight. You can easily keep attention on the most outgoing player or hero, but you need to check in with all the players. If a player hasn't contributed in some time, stop and ask, "What's your hero doing at this point?" If the player isn't sure, add a detail or NPC to the scene that the player might find interesting.</p>
<h3>Distractions and Interruptions</h3>
<p>Maintaining the players' attention keeps a game moving and leads to memorable moments when everyone's in the zone. Too many interruptions break the flow. Some distractions will always happen, like jokes at the table, but make sure interruptions aren't too frequent. It helps to plan breaks into the game. A 10-minute break is a great time to grab a snack, use the restroom, or look up something on your phone.</p>

<h3>Ending a Session</h3>
<p>It's best to have a planned end time before your session starts. As your game goes on, keep an eye on the time. When you have around 20 minutes left in your session, start looking for good stopping places. Unless you're finishing up an adventure, try to find a good cliffhanger to end on. This can be just before a fight starts, the moment the heroes find out a new piece of information or enter a new area, or any other point that creates suspense!</p>
<p>Before everybody leaves, have them tally up their XP. They'll need to level up before the next session if it's over 1,000! The characters can also divide treasure and items.</p>
<p>Before your next session, you might need to prepare for the next stage of the adventure. If the adventure concluded this session, talk with the players about whether they want to start a new adventure. If so, start preparing the next adventure for your upcoming session!</p>
