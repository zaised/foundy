<p class="box-text narrative">A clifftop cemetery that's mostly quiet but has a sinister atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Places</h3>
<p>High on the cliff above the Dawnflower Library, the Otari Graveyard holds crumbling mausoleums and groves of leafless trees. Few enter this ancient cemetery other than the acolytes who tend it, as it’s hard to reach even though it looms over the town. Rumors of undead roaming the cemetery at night persist among Otari’s most superstitious townspeople.</p>
