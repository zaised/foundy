<p>As the Game Master, it’s up to you to set the difficulty classes (DCs) for checks that don’t already say what the DC is. Most adventures include the most important DCs in them, but the players will improvise and try things the adventure writer didn’t think of! Always base the DC on how hard the task is, regardless of how good at it the heroes are. Sometimes the players will attempt something that’s really easy for them, and that’s okay!</p>
<p>If the DC is for something with a level, like a spell or item, see Level-Based DCs below.</p>

<h1>Table 10-4: Simple DCs</h1>
<p>You can select a simple DC from the table below by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task (that rank isn't required to succeed at the task, just used for guidance).</p>
<p>• If pretty much anyone would have a decent chance, use the untrained DC.</p>
<p>• If anyone with some training has a solid chance, use the trained DC.</p>
<p>• If someone has to be highly skilled, use the expert DC.</p>
<p>• If this task is highly unlikely for a hero to be able to achieve, use the master DC.</p>

<h1>Table 10-5: Level-Based DCs</h1>
<p>When you're determining a skill DC based on something that has a level, such as when a hero needs to Recall Knowledge about a creature or Identify a Spell, use a level-based DC. Find the level of the subject on the table, and assign the corresponding DC. Creatures and spells use different scales, so make sure you use the correct column.</p>

<h1>Table 10-6: DC Adjustments</h1>
<p>You might decide a DC should differ from the baseline. For instance, maybe when the heroes reached a cliff, they climbed it with a DC of 15, but when they came back, it was raining. You could adjust the DC up to 17 because it's harder to climb in these conditions. Similarly, the rarity of a creature or item might influence the DC to recall knowledge about it.</p>
