<p>The door leading into this chamber is made from stone, making it impossible to break or force open. The only way to open this door is to solve the puzzle in @JournalEntry[l4u0BkEqhLFD3PHW]{Area 09}. If the players accomplished this feat, the door is open. In that case, read the following aloud.</p>
<p class="box-text narrative">This small chamber contains an old wooden chest emblazoned with the symbol of a key. Behind the chest is a massive contraption of gears and pulleys that looks like the inner workings of some unseen device.</p>
<p>This chamber holds the blessings of Abadar and the control mechanism for the traps in @JournalEntry[73RoOAzThOUOCmbg]{Area 11}.</p>
<p>Although the room is dark when the heroes first enter, they can see tiny shafts of light coming from the wall on the north side. Tiny holes in the wall allow them to peek into Area 11. On the far side of this area is a kobold, standing watch. If the heroes listen, they can hear fragments of a quiet conversation between a few other kobolds, out of sight, talking about "the boss's new pet" and plans for "the town above."</p>

<p>The unlocked chest contains the blessing of Abadar. Inside is a pile of coins, a rolled-up piece of parchment, and a small glass box containing a single emerald. The coins consist of 214 cp, 22 sp, and 3 gp, plus any coins that the heroes lost to the puzzle in Area 9. The heroes can also sell the emerald for 20 gp.</p>
<p>The piece of parchment is a <em>scroll of magic missile</em>. An Arcane or Occult spellcaster (like the iconic wizard, Ezren) can use this scroll to cast the spell magic missile without expending a spell slot or even having it prepared. Once used, the scroll crumbles to dust.</p>

<h2>Control Mechanism</h2>
<p>If a hero examines the chest, they notice a lever protruding from the back of it. Have them roll a @Check[type:crafting|dc:15]{Crafting Skill Check} check. If the hero succeeds, they realize that this mechanism controls a trap hidden in Area 11, though from here they can’t tell precisely how the trap is triggered or what it does.</p>
<p>The lever is currently set to the “disarmed” position. If the heroes set it to the “active” position, the trap in Area 11 activates.</p>
<h2>Experience Points</h2>
<p>Sometimes the heroes might earn XP for taking actions to make things easier later on. If the heroes find the lever and set it to activate the trap, give them each 30 XP for their accomplishment.</p>
