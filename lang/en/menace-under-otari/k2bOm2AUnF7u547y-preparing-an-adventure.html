<p>Building your own adventure is more challenging than using a published one, but it lets you express yourself, apply even more creativity, and tailor the game directly to the players and their heroes! You can also use these guidelines to alter the adventure in this book or other published adventures to suit your preferences.</p>
<h3>Types of Adventures</h3>
<p>Adventures can be structured in different ways. A linear adventure has a set path with one encounter leading to another. A nonlinear adventure involves creating an environment with multiple paths the heroes can explore in any order. Finally, a sandbox adventure takes place over a wide environment with the players setting their own goals. For your first adventures, start simple with either a fully linear adventure or one with only a small number of optional paths.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>When you decide to build an adventure, first come up with a basic plot or theme for it. Think of this step like casting a play rather than writing out every scene. You’re picking enemies and places where cool things can take place, but only by improvising with the other players during play will you find out what happens!</p>
<p>Adventure plotting can start at many different points. You might begin with a particular antagonist, then construct an adventure that fits that villain’s theme and leads the group to them. Alternatively, you could start with an interesting location for exploration, then populate it with adversaries and challenges appropriate to the setting.</p>

<h2>Building a Campaign</h2>
<p>Just because an adventure ends, it doesn’t mean the whole game has to! You can continue with the same group and heroes in an ongoing campaign. A campaign is a connected series of adventures. You can build new adventures based on what happened in the last one, or you can adapt prewritten adventures to carry on the story.</p>
<p>Campaigns work better if you carry forward some NPCs, themes, and villains from adventure to adventure. For example, after “Menace under Otari,” you can use the @JournalEntry[NNmKsnjJOZogP2fO]{Otari} section to get some ideas for what you might include in your next adventure. You can also get more adventures for your campaign with the Pathfinder Adventures book Troubles in Otari or the three-book Adventure Path Abomination Vaults.</p>
<p>As you get more used to being a Game Master, you can start planning out campaigns from the start, with different themes and styles. But for your first game, it’s usually best to start with one adventure and expand from there to get the hang of GMing.</p>
