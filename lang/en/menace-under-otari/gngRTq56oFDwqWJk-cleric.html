<p>Kyra is a priestess of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae}, a sun goddess who teaches her followers to heal the wounded and destroy evil. Kyra grew up admiring the beautiful stained glass of Sarenrae's temple and the graceful priestesses who practiced with their scimitars each dawn.</p>
<p>When bandits attacked Kyra's village, those priestesses fought to the death to protect the villagers, but the bandits were too many and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the beautiful temple she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, promising to protect those who could not protect themselves and to slay those who would harm the innocent.</p>
<p>Kyra has a fierce will, and is proud of her faith and her skill with the scimitar.</p>
