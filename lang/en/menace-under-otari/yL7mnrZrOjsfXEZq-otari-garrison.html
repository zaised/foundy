<p class="box-text narrative first">A squat, bunker-like stone building that houses Otari’s civic guards.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>The Otari Guard keeps the peace in town, and their leader is the gruff and stout Captain Lardus Longsaddle. Any heroes who get in trouble with the Otari Guard should hope to deal with anyone other than the captain—his curse-laden tirades are legendary, and he’s inclined to issue short jail sentences for minor infractions. Conversely, heroes who catch criminals earn a rare (though often short-lived) position on Captain Longsaddle’s good side, earning bounties from the captain’s pay chest. Fighters might have trained with the Otari Guard or aspired to join their ranks.</p>
<h3>Gathering Places</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Otari Guard is a sturdy stone building hung with green-and-white banners that match the guards’ uniforms. These guards keep the peace in town and patrol the surrounding roads to ensure they stay free of banditry and trouble. The guards also serve as the town’s firefighters. Heroes might visit the garrison to hear about bandits or other adventure opportunities—or they might end up in one of the jail cells in the basement if they cause a ruckus in town!</p>
