<p class="box-text narrative first">A peculiar curio shop run by an eccentric woman who collects rumors.</p>
<h3>Goods and Services</h3>
<p>This odd, domed building is always open. The proprietor, Wrin Sivinxi, sells adventuring gear, consumable magic items (except ammunition), held magic items, magic wands, and worn magic items. Wrin is a bit unusual, seeing menace in every corner and truths in the constellations above, but sheâ€™s eager to get to know adventurers and show off the many magical trinkets in her collection. She also gathers rumors and therefore makes a good contact for a group of heroes looking for their next adventure!</p>
