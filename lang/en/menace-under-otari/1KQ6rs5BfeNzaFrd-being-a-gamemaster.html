<p>Every Pathfinder game needs a Game Master (GM for short). As Game Master, you run each game session, providing the link between the players and the world of the game. It’s up to you to set the scene as the heroes battle monsters, interact with other people, and explore the world.</p>
<p>Being a GM is like organizing a party for your friends. You want to make sure they arrive on time, have plenty to do, and have a good time. You’re in charge of...</p>
<ul>
<li>Telling the story of the group’s adventures in a compelling and consistent way.</li>
<li>Fleshing out the world in which the game takes place.</li>
<li>Entertaining the players and yourself and rewarding creative ideas.</li>
<li>Preparing for game sessions by studying or building adventures and creating characters and plots.</li>
<li>Improvising the reactions of characters the heroes meet as the players do unexpected things.</li>
<li>Making rules decisions to ensure fairness and keep the game moving at a good pace.</li>
<li>Rewarding the heroes for their deeds with Experience Points (XP) and treasure.</li>
<li>You’re not trying to “win” the game by beating the heroes. Your job is to provide a fun story with some challenges. Those challenges can be tough to beat, and the heroes can fail sometimes or even die on occasion. But they should always have a fighting chance!</li>

<h2>Common Terms</h2>
<p>The following terms are used to describe certain common game elements.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A challenge is one short scene that puts the heroes to the test. This could be anything from fighting a monster to chasing a thief or getting past a deadly trap.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> An encounter is a combat that plays out in a series of rounds with creatures taking actions in turn.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration:</strong> Between encounters, heroes are exploring. Usually, this means exploring an environment, but they might explore a social situation, a puzzle, or something else.</p>
<p><strong>Session:</strong> A session is a single period of gaming, ranging from about 2 hours up to an entire weekend. In a session, you might complete a whole adventure or just part of one.</p>
<p><strong>Adventure:</strong> An adventure is one story that the heroes experience. It’s made up of a series of explorations broken up by a series of encounters. Adventures might take one or more sessions to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign:</strong> Campaign is a term used to describe all of the adventures that the heroes experience. The adventures might relate to one another, but not all of the adventures have to be tied into the same overarching plot.</p>

<p>Before you can run a game, you need to prepare the adventure your group will play through. An adventure is a self-contained collection of story elements, characters, and settings that become the basis for the story you and the other players tell. Think of the adventure as an outline for your story. You’ll have major plot points you want to include, some consistent characters, and themes you want to convey, but all sorts of things can change during the process of turning the outline into a completed story!</p>
<p>The @JournalEntry[67xrow8BHnKbKozv]{Menace Under Otari} adventure has much of the preparation done for you. Reading the adventure and looking over the materials in the Beginner Box gives you enough preparation to run that adventure. “Menace Under Otari” and other prewritten adventures are built for groups of a specific level. They include setup information and nonplayer characters (NPCs) needed for the story, plus all the locations, maps, and monster groups; they also give out the appropriate amount of XP and treasure. Running one as your first game can help you see how adventures are structured, which makes it easier to write your own later if you choose. Though a published adventure is prewritten, its events aren’t set in stone. Changing the details of an adventure to suit your group isn’t just OK, it’s preferred! Adjust things to make the adventure appeal to your players more, and add to the adventure in ways that will make your players happy.</p>
<p>When writing your own adventures, you’ll need to prepare further by picking monsters, drawing maps, and coming up with NPCs that live in the world. This takes more time on your part but also lets you customize your game to your group. You’ll find more about creating your own adventures in @JournalEntry[k2bOm2AUnF7u547y]{Preparing an Adventure}.</p>
<p>As the Game Master, you get to work with all the other players to see how the story of the adventure unfolds. While they’ll each play their individual heroes, you’ll assume the role of all the monsters, villagers, and other characters that they encounter. You decide how those people and monsters act, what they do in combat, and what intriguing clues they might give to the heroes. You’ll also describe each area the heroes explore so the other players can imagine the setting and decide how their heroes respond to what’s going on around them. These are the tools you use to help shape the story with the other players.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that you’re not playing against the other players. This is a game where everyone wins if everyone has a fun time. Monsters are meant to be defeated, and treasure is there to be found. Try to make the players feel like they have earned their success without being too tough on the heroes they’re playing.</p>
